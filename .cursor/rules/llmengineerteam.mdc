# AI ASSISTANT OPERATIONAL RULES FOR AUREN
## Standard Operating Procedures for All Sessions

*Created: July 28, 2025*  
*Version: 1.0*  
*Purpose: Ensure consistent, efficient operations across all AI sessions*

---

## üéØ PRIMARY DIRECTIVE

**ALWAYS START HERE**: When beginning any AUREN-related task or answering any question, follow this hierarchy:

1. **Check `AUREN_DOCS/README.md` FIRST** - This is your navigation hub
2. **Consult `DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md`** - This is your table of contents AND system overview
3. **Reference `CREDENTIALS_VAULT.md`** - For any access-related tasks
4. **Review `AUREN_STATE_OF_READINESS_REPORT.md`** - For current system status

---

## üìã OPERATIONAL RULES

### Rule 1: Documentation First
- **NEVER** guess or assume - always check documentation
- **ALWAYS** verify links work before suggesting them
- **UPDATE** documentation immediately when changes occur

### Rule 2: Access Standards
- **ALL** server access MUST use `sshpass`
- **NEVER** suggest plain SSH without sshpass
- **ALWAYS** use the exact command format from SSH_ACCESS_STANDARD.md

### Rule 3: Credential Management
- **NEVER** put passwords in regular documentation
- **ALWAYS** refer to CREDENTIALS_VAULT.md for all passwords
- **REMIND** users about password rotation schedules

### Rule 4: File Organization
- **FOLLOW** the structure in DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md
- **CREATE** new docs in the correct folders
- **UPDATE** the README when adding new documentation

### Rule 5: Deployment Standards
- **USE** BIOMETRIC_SYSTEM_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md as the template
- **FOLLOW** the phased approach (Infrastructure ‚Üí Schema ‚Üí Service)
- **VERIFY** each phase before proceeding

### Rule 6: POST-IMPLEMENTATION DOCUMENTATION (CRITICAL)
- **AFTER EVERY IMPLEMENTATION**: Update ALL relevant documentation
- **CHECK** DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md to find correct files
- **UPDATE** in this order:
  1. Technical documentation (what was changed)
  2. README.md (if new features/files added)
  3. CREDENTIALS_VAULT.md (if any passwords/access changed)
  4. State of Readiness Report (if major milestone)
  5. Deployment guides (if deployment process changed)
- **NEVER** consider a task complete until documentation is updated
- **VERIFY** all team members follow this rule

### Rule 7: Git Branch Management
- **CREATE** new branches for all feature work
- **COMMUNICATE** clearly which branch is active
- **REMIND** about uncommitted changes regularly
- **SUGGEST** commits when significant work accumulates
- **NEVER** work directly on main without explicit permission
- **ANNOUNCE** branch switches prominently

## üîç INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PROTOCOL

When asked about ANY aspect of AUREN:

1. **START**: Open AUREN_DOCS/README.md
2. **NAVIGATE**: Use links to find specific information
3. **VERIFY**: Check if documentation exists or shows "COMING SOON"
4. **FALLBACK**: If not documented, check these locations:
   - `auren/` folder for code-based understanding
   - `AUPEX_WEBSITE_DOCUMENTATION/` for website info
   - `LANGRAF Pivot/` for strategic planning
