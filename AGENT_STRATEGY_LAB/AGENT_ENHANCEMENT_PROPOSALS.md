# AGENT ENHANCEMENT PROPOSALS 🚀
*Strategic Enhancement Ideas for AUREN Human Performance OS*

**Last Updated**: July 31, 2025  
**Status**: Active Development - 6 Unfilled Functional Domains Identified  
**Priority**: High-Leverage Gaps for Strategic Discussion

---

## 🎯 **OVERVIEW: MISSING AGENT DOMAINS**

The current AUREN framework covers "brain & nerves" (NEUROS), "food & macros" (NUTROS), and the overall conductor (AUREN). However, **six critical functional domains** remain unfilled, representing significant opportunities for human performance optimization.

**Strategic Gap Analysis**: We need agents that (1) move the body, (2) grow the body, (3) power the heart & metabolic engine, (4) dose peptides & endocrine levers, (5) see aesthetic changes, and (6) restore deep sleep-recovery.

## 🔍 **UNFILLED FUNCTIONAL DOMAINS**

### **1. Mobility & Injury-Proofing Domain**

2. **Data-Driven Evolution**: Agent capabilities evolve based on user data and feedback
3. **Cross-Pollination**: Agents learn from each other's insights and recommendations
4. **Adaptive Specialization**: Agents develop deeper expertise in areas of highest user need

### **Phased Rollout Strategy**
```yaml
Phase 1 (Months 3-4): Foundation Movement & Strength
  - KINETOS: Movement assessment and injury prevention
  - HYPERTROS: Strength programming and periodization
