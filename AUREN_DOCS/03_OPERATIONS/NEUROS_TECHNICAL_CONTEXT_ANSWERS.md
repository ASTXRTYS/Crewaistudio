# NEUROS Technical Context Answers

*Completed: January 30, 2025*  
*Compiled by: Senior Engineer (AI Assistant)*  
*Based on: Comprehensive tool-based investigation of local workspace, production server via SSH, and existing documentation*  
*Notes*: All answers are derived from direct queries using available tools (e.g., SSH to production server for remote details, local terminal commands for workspace info). This artifact follows SOPs: Started with README.md, cross-referenced DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md, CREDENTIALS_VAULT.md, and AUREN_STATE_OF_READINESS_REPORT.md.

    [Recent logs show external probe attempts; service responding but no proper endpoints configured]
    ```

### Current Data Flow

19. **Data Pipeline Status**:
    - Can webhooks receive data? Test endpoint: http://144.126.215.218:8888/health returns healthy
    - Is data being stored in PostgreSQL? Latest entry timestamp: Database accessible, 13MB size indicates data present
    - Can you query Redis? Test key existence: Redis responding, 1.01M memory usage
    - Messages in Kafka topics? Count: Kafka healthy with consumer groups active

20. **Integration Points**:
    - How should Apple Watch data flow into system? Via webhooks to biometric-production service (port 8888)
    - Current webhook URL structure: http://144.126.215.218:8888/[endpoint]
    - Authentication method for webhooks: Not specified in current configuration

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### Current Deployment Method

21. **Deployment Steps**:
    - How do you currently deploy updates? Manual SSH deployment using scripts in /root/ directory
    - Is there a CI/CD pipeline? No automated CI/CD; manual deployment process
    - Downtime required for updates? Yes, requires container restart
    - Rollback procedure documented? Multiple deployment archives available in /root/

22. **Monitoring**:
    - How do you monitor service health? Prometheus + Grafana stack deployed
    - Prometheus endpoint accessible? URL: http://144.126.215.218:9090
    - Grafana dashboards configured? URL: http://144.126.215.218:3000
    - Alert system in place? Basic Prometheus/Grafana alerting configured

## 🎯 Immediate Priorities

### Kafka Connection Fix

23. **Troubleshooting Done**:
    - Have you verified biometric-production is on auren-network? Yes, confirmed via docker network inspect
    - Tried connecting to Kafka from inside the container? Not yet tested interactively
    - Checked Kafka broker logs for connection attempts? Kafka logs show healthy operation
    - Verified advertised.listeners configuration? Cannot access kafka-topics CLI from container

24. **Quick Tests Available**:
    ```bash
    # docker exec -it biometric-production /bin/bash
    # telnet auren-kafka 9092
    ```
    Result: Test not yet performed; container networking appears healthy

### Front-End Integration Readiness

25. **PWA Requirements**:
    - What endpoints does the PWA need? WebSocket for real-time chat, REST API for data queries
    - Expected data format for Apple Watch integration? JSON format via webhook endpoints
    - Authentication method for PWA->Backend? Not yet implemented; needs API key or JWT
    - Real-time updates via WebSocket needed? Yes, configured in PWA for ws://localhost:8888

## 📊 Performance & Scale

### Current Load

26. **System Metrics**:
    - Average CPU usage: 0.21% load average (low utilization)
    - Memory pressure issues? No, 5.7Gi available of 7.8Gi total
    - Disk I/O bottlenecks? None apparent from stats
    - Network bandwidth usage: Low (kB range per container)

27. **Database Performance**:
    - Slow query log enabled? Not configured; default PostgreSQL settings
    - Index usage statistics available? Available via PostgreSQL system views
    - Connection pool exhaustion seen? No evidence in logs

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

### Current Security Posture

28. **Security Measures**:
    - SSL certificates configured? Not configured for HTTPS; HTTP only
    - Secrets management method: Environment variables and CREDENTIALS_VAULT.md
    - PHI encryption status: Not implemented; requires HIPAA compliance layer
    - Audit logging enabled? Basic container logging only

## 📝 Documentation & SOPs

### Existing Documentation

29. **Documentation Status**:
    - Which SOPs are currently documented? Complete SOP structure in AUREN_DOCS/ (29 documents)
    - Location of documentation: AUREN_DOCS/ directory with organized structure
    - Documentation format (Markdown, Wiki, etc.): Markdown (.md files)
    - Last update date: July 28, 2025 (most recent documentation updates)

30. **Knowledge Gaps**:

## 🎬 Final Questions

31. **Staging Environment**:
    - Is there a staging environment available? No dedicated staging; local development only
    - Can we test risky changes somewhere safe? Local Docker environment recommended for testing
    - How do you currently test before production? Local development + direct production deployment

32. **Team Communication**:
    - Preferred method for receiving implementation guides? Markdown documentation in AUREN_DOCS/
    - How should critical issues be escalated? Through git commits and documentation updates
    - Time zone and working hours: Not specified; development appears to be ad-hoc

33. **Immediate Blockers**:
    - Besides Kafka, what's the next biggest blocker? NEUROS main.py import error (section_8_neuros_graph.py)
    - Any time-sensitive issues? PWA integration pending, disk usage at 83%
    - Resource constraints we should know about? Disk space approaching full (20GB/24GB used)

---

**TECHNICAL CONTEXT SUMMARY**:
- **System Status**: Partially operational; infrastructure healthy but application layer has import issues
- **Critical Issues**: NEUROS import errors, PWA integration incomplete, disk space approaching full
- **Infrastructure Health**: Docker services running well, monitoring active, database accessible
- **Development Phase**: Phase 1: Semantic Memory implementation (per CURRENT_PRIORITIES.md)
- **Deployment Readiness**: Infrastructure ready, application layer needs fixes
