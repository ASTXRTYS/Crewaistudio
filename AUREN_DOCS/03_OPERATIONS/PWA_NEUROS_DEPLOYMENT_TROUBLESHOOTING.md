# AUREN SOP: PWA + NEUROS Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

*   **Created**: [Current Date]
*   **Author**: Senior Engineer (AI Assistant)
*   **Version**: 1.0
*   **Purpose**: A definitive, layer-by-layer guide to diagnosing and resolving common deployment issues between the PWA frontend and the NEUROS AI backend. This document is the standard procedure for any engineer encountering related problems.

## üéØ **Primary Philosophy: Isolate the Failure Layer**

Modern containerized deployments have multiple failure points. Guessing is inefficient. This guide follows a systematic, bottom-up approach to isolate the problem, from the host machine's Docker daemon to the application code itself. **Do not skip layers.**

---

##  Layer 1: The Sanity Check - Is Docker Even Running?

This is the most fundamental layer. Without a running Docker daemon, nothing else matters.

### **Symptoms**

You will see errors like:

```text
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///Users/Jason/.docker/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
Error response from daemon:
```

### **Diagnostic & Resolution**

1.  **Confirm Docker is running.** On macOS or Windows, this means ensuring the Docker Desktop application is open and has finished initializing.
2.  **Start Docker.** If it's not running, start it. On macOS, this can be done from the terminal:
    ```bash
    open -a Docker
    ```
3.  **Wait and Verify.** Give the daemon 15-30 seconds to initialize, then run a simple command to confirm it's responsive:
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
    If this command returns a table (even an empty one) instead of an error, you have successfully cleared Layer 1.

## Layer 2: The Dependency Deep-Dive - The Environment Mismatch

This was the core of our recent deployment issue. An incorrect or incomplete Python environment inside the container is a common and frustrating problem.

### **Symptoms**

*   `docker-compose build` fails during `pip install`.
*   Container starts but immediately exits with `ModuleNotFoundError`.
*   Errors like `ResolutionImpossible` or `conflicting dependencies`.

### **Root Cause Analysis: The LangGraph v0.2+ Paradigm Shift**

The primary blocker was a misunderstanding of a critical change in the `langgraph` library:

*   **Before v0.2:** Checkpointer implementations (like for PostgreSQL) were included in the main `langgraph` package as "extras" (e.g., `langgraph[postgres]`).
*   **After v0.2:** Checkpointers were moved to **separate, standalone PyPI packages**.

This means `langgraph[postgres]` is an invalid package. The correct approach is to install the specific checkpointer package.

### **Diagnostic & Resolution**

1.  **Stop and Nuke Everything.** Do not attempt to debug a potentially corrupted environment. Start clean.
    ```bash
    docker-compose down -v
    docker system prune -f
    ```

2.  **Fix `requirements.txt`.** This is the blueprint for your container's environment. Ensure it is correct.

    **GOLD STANDARD `requirements.txt`:**
    ```python
    # AI Providers & Core Framework
    fastapi
    langchain>=0.2.17
    langchain-core
    langchain-openai
    langgraph>=0.2.0
    langsmith
    openai>=1.33.0
    uvicorn

    # LangGraph v0.2+ Checkpointer (CRITICAL)
    langgraph-checkpoint-postgres>=1.0.0

    # Infrastructure & Database
    asyncpg>=0.29.0
    kafka-python>=2.0.2
    psycopg[binary]>=3.1.0  # Required for Postgres checkpointer
    psycopg2-binary>=2.9.9
    redis>=5.0.0

    # Observability
    opentelemetry-api>=1.20.0
    opentelemetry-exporter-prometheus>=0.41b0
    opentelemetry-sdk>=1.20.0

    # Utilities & Web
    pydantic-settings>=2.0.0
    python-dotenv>=1.0.0
    streamlit>=1.30.0

    # Testing
    pytest>=7.4.0
    pytest-asyncio>=0.21.0
    pytest-cov>=4.1.0
    ```

3.  **Fix the `init_checkpointer.py` Import.** The code using the checkpointer must also be updated.

    **GOLD STANDARD `init_checkpointer.py`:**
    ```python
    # ‚úÖ NEW (v0.2+): Import from the separate package
    from langgraph_checkpoint_postgres import PostgresSaver
    import asyncio

    async def setup():
        # Note: The autocommit=true is not needed here, psycopg handles it.
        DB_URI = "postgresql://postgres:example@postgres:5432/neuros"
        
        # The checkpointer now returns a context manager. Use 'async with'.
        async with PostgresSaver.from_conn_string(DB_URI) as checkpointer:
            # The .setup() method is called implicitly by the context manager.
            # No need to call it manually.
            print("‚úÖ Checkpointer tables created/verified!")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(setup())
    ```
    *Note: The latest API for `PostgresSaver` uses a context manager (`async with`), which handles setup and teardown automatically. The `await checkpointer.setup()` call is no longer needed inside the `with` block.*

---

## Layer 3: The Container Build - A Repeatable Blueprint

Your `Dockerfile` should be minimal and robust. It should explicitly install dependencies to avoid ambiguity.

### **Symptoms**

*   `pip install` fails with cryptic errors.
*   Executables like `uvicorn` or `psql` are not found in the container's `$PATH`.

### **Diagnostic & Resolution**

1.  **Create a Gold Standard `Dockerfile`**. This version installs system dependencies needed by Python packages (`libpq-dev` for `psycopg`) and uses a multi-stage `pip install` process for clarity and robustness.

    **GOLD STANDARD `Dockerfile`:**
    ```Dockerfile
    FROM python:3.12-slim

    WORKDIR /app

    # Install system dependencies required for Python packages like psycopg
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
        gcc \
        libpq-dev \
        && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

    # Copy requirements first to leverage Docker layer caching
    COPY requirements.txt .

    # Upgrade pip and install all dependencies from the requirements file
    RUN pip install --upgrade pip && \
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Copy the rest of the application code
    COPY . .

    # The CMD will be specified in docker-compose.yml for flexibility
    ```

---

## Layer 4: The Runtime Configuration - Orchestrating the Services

`docker-compose.yml` ties everything together. Small errors here can cause cascading failures.

### **Symptoms**

*   Containers fail to start or exit immediately.
*   Connection refused errors between containers.
*   `nc: command not found` or other shell errors in logs.

### **Diagnostic & Resolution**

1.  **Implement Health Checks.** This is non-negotiable. It ensures dependent services don't start until their dependencies are actually ready, not just "running".
2.  **Use Correct Service Names for Networking.** Containers on the same Docker network talk to each other using their service names (e.g., `postgres`), not `localhost`.
3.  **Ensure Startup Commands are Robust.** Avoid using shell utilities like `nc` that may not exist in slim base images.

    **GOLD STANDARD `docker-compose.yml`:**
    ```yaml
    services:
      redis:
        image: redis:alpine
        container_name: redis
        healthcheck:
          test: ["CMD", "redis-cli", "ping"]
          interval: 5s
          timeout: 3s
          retries: 5
        networks:
          - neuros_network
        
      postgres:
        image: postgres:16
        container_name: postgres
        environment:
          - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=example
          - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
          - POSTGRES_DB=neuros
        healthcheck:
          test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres"]
          interval: 5s
          timeout: 3s
          retries: 5
        networks:
          - neuros_network
        
      neuros:
        build: .
        container_name: neuros
        depends_on:
          redis:
            condition: service_healthy # Waits for Redis to be healthy
          postgres:
            condition: service_healthy # Waits for PostgreSQL to be healthy
        environment:
          - REDIS_OM_URL=redis://redis:6379
          - DATABASE_URI=postgresql://postgres:example@postgres:5432/neuros
          - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY} # Ensure this is in a .env file
        networks:
          - neuros_network
        ports:
          - "8000:8000"
        command: |
          bash -c "
            echo 'Running checkpointer setup...' &&
            python init_checkpointer.py && 
            echo 'Starting application server...' &&
            python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
          "

    networks:
      neuros_network:
    ```

## Layer 5: In-Container Verification - The Final Proof

Once the containers are running, you need to confirm that everything *inside* them is working as expected.

### **Symptoms**

*   The container is "Up" but the application inside is not responding or has errors.
*   You suspect dependencies are installed but not importable.

### **Diagnostic & Resolution**

1.  **Check the Logs First.** This is the fastest way to see the output of your startup command.
    ```bash
    docker logs neuros
    ```
2.  **Create a Verification Script.** If logs are unclear, a targeted script can prove the environment is sound.

    **GOLD STANDARD `test_imports.py`:**
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    """Test that all critical imports work"""

    try:
        print("Testing imports...")
        
        import fastapi
        print("‚úÖ FastAPI imported")
        
        import langgraph
        print("‚úÖ LangGraph imported")
        
        from langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver
        print("‚úÖ PostgresSaver imported successfully!")
        
        import redis
        import asyncpg
        import uvicorn
        print("‚úÖ All other dependencies imported")
        
        print("\nüéâ All imports successful! The environment is correctly set up.")
        
    except ImportError as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Import failed: {e}")
    ```

3.  **Execute the Script in the Running Container.**
    ```bash
    # First, ensure the container is running
    docker-compose up -d

    # Copy the script to the container and execute it
    docker cp test_imports.py neuros:/app/
    docker exec neuros python test_imports.py
    ```
    A successful output from this script is the definitive confirmation that your environment is correct.

## üöÄ **The Full Troubleshooting Workflow**

1.  `docker ps` -> **Confirm daemon is running.**
2.  `docker-compose down -v && docker system prune -f` -> **Nuke the old environment.**
3.  **Apply Gold Standard files** -> Update `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `init_checkpointer.py`.
4.  `docker-compose build --no-cache` -> **Build a fresh image.**
5.  `docker-compose up -d` -> **Start the services.**
6.  `docker logs neuros` -> **Check for startup errors.**
7.  `docker exec neuros python test_imports.py` -> **Verify the environment.**

By following these layers, any engineer can systematically and efficiently resolve this class of deployment issues without guesswork.
