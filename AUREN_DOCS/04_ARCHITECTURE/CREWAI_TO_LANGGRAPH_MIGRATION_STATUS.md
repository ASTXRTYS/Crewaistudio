# CrewAI to LangGraph Migration Status

**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Author**: Senior Engineer  
**Status**: IN ANALYSIS üîç  
**Purpose**: Track the migration from CrewAI to LangGraph for production deployment

---

## üìä Executive Summary

AUREN's Section 12 deployment revealed extensive CrewAI dependencies that must be migrated to LangGraph for production readiness. This document tracks the migration progress and serves as the central reference for all migration activities.

**Current State**: CrewAI deeply integrated, blocking 100% completion  
**Target State**: Pure LangGraph implementation with production features  
**Impact**: 7% of system completion (93% ‚Üí 100%)

## üîç Migration Investigation Results

### CrewAI Usage Analysis (from `crewai_migration_investigation.sh`)

```
‚úÖ FOUND: CrewAI in requirements.txt
crewai==0.30.11
crewai-tools==0.2.6

‚úÖ FOUND: CrewAI in setup.py
Multiple references to crewai packages
```

### Affected Components

1. **Core Dependencies**
   - `auren/requirements.txt`: Contains crewai==0.30.11
   - `setup.py`: References CrewAI packages
   - Python modules with CrewAI imports

2. **Modules Requiring Migration**
   - NEUROS cognitive graph implementation
   - Biometric event processing bridge
   - Agent orchestration layers
   - Memory tier management

3. **Dependency Conflicts**
   ```
   ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt...
   - crewai 0.30.11 requires openai>=1.13.3
   - langchain-openai 0.0.5 requires openai>=1.10.0
   ```

## üéØ LangGraph Migration Requirements

Based on the LangGraph Mastery Guide, we need:

### 1. **State Management Architecture**
```python
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from operator import add

class AURENState(TypedDict):
    # Core fields
    user_id: str
    current_mode: str
    
    # Fields with reducers for parallel operations
    biometric_events: Annotated[list, add]
    hypotheses: Annotated[dict, lambda a, b: {**a, **b}]
    confidence_scores: Annotated[list, add]
    
    # Memory tiers
    hot_memory: dict
    warm_memory: dict
    cold_memory: dict
```

### 2. **Checkpointing & Persistence**
```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver
from langgraph.store.postgres import PostgresStore

# Use existing PostgreSQL
DB_URI = "postgresql://auren_user:auren_secure_2025@localhost:5432/auren_production"
checkpointer = PostgresSaver.from_conn_string(DB_URI)
store = PostgresStore.from_conn_string(DB_URI)
```

### 3. **Parallel Processing Pattern**
```python
from langgraph.constants import Send

def analyze_biometrics_parallel(state: AURENState):
    return [
        Send("analyze_hrv", {"data": state["hrv_data"]}),
        Send("analyze_sleep", {"data": state["sleep_data"]}),
        Send("analyze_activity", {"data": state["activity_data"]})
    ]
```

## üìã Migration Checklist

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning ‚è≥
- [x] Run migration investigation script
- [x] Document CrewAI usage patterns
- [x] Identify all affected modules
- [ ] Create detailed migration plan
- [ ] Map CrewAI patterns to LangGraph equivalents

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Create LangGraph state definitions
- [ ] Implement PostgreSQL checkpointing
- [ ] Set up cross-thread memory store
- [ ] Create base graph structure
- [ ] Implement error handling patterns

### Phase 3: Component Migration
- [ ] Migrate NEUROS cognitive modes
- [ ] Convert biometric bridge to LangGraph
- [ ] Implement memory tier management
- [ ] Create webhook processors
- [ ] Add health/metrics endpoints

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Unit tests for all nodes
- [ ] Integration tests for graphs
- [ ] Load testing with concurrent threads
- [ ] Chaos testing for resilience
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

### Phase 5: Deployment
- [ ] Create clean requirements.txt
- [ ] Build Docker image
- [ ] Deploy to staging (port 8889)
- [ ] Validate all endpoints
- [ ] Cutover to production (port 8888)

## üöß Known Challenges

### 1. **State Management Complexity**
- Must use reducers for all parallel-updated fields
- Risk of InvalidUpdateError without proper reducers
- Need to manage state size limits

### 2. **Async Pattern Differences**
- CrewAI uses different async patterns
- LangGraph requires specific async/await usage
- Connection pooling needs refactoring

### 3. **Memory Tier Integration**
- Current 3-tier system must map to LangGraph
- Need proper state transitions
- Checkpointing strategy required

## üîó Resources

1. **LangGraph Documentation**: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/
2. **Migration Examples**: 
   - Uber's code migration system
   - LinkedIn's SQL Bot
   - Elastic's threat detection
3. **Internal Docs**:
   - LangGraph Mastery Guide (provided)
   - Section 12 Implementation Guide
   - NEUROS Architecture Docs

## üìù Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Wait for background agent's complete analysis
2. **Short-term**: Create component-by-component migration plan
3. **Medium-term**: Begin migrating lowest-risk components first
4. **Long-term**: Full production deployment with LangGraph

## üéØ Success Criteria

Migration is complete when:
- ‚úÖ Zero CrewAI imports remain
- ‚úÖ All tests pass with LangGraph
- ‚úÖ Performance meets or exceeds current system
- ‚úÖ Section 12 deploys successfully
- ‚úÖ System reaches 100% completion
