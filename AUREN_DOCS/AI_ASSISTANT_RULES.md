# AI ASSISTANT OPERATIONAL RULES FOR AUREN
## Standard Operating Procedures for All Sessions

*Created: July 28, 2025*  
*Version: 2.0*  
*Purpose: Ensure consistent, efficient, and continuously optimizing operations*

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: NO content may be removed from this file without explicit authorization from the Founder/Visionary (Human).

---

## üéØ PRIMARY DIRECTIVE

**ALWAYS START HERE**: When beginning any AUREN-related task or answering any question, follow this hierarchy:

1. **Check `AUREN_DOCS/README.md` FIRST** - Your navigation hub
2. **Consult `AUREN_DOCS/01_ARCHITECTURE/DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md`** - Your complete table of contents AND navigation map
3. **Reference `AUREN_DOCS/00_QUICK_START/CREDENTIALS_VAULT.md`** - For any access-related tasks
4. **Review `auren/AUREN_STATE_OF_READINESS_REPORT.md`** - Shows what's BUILT vs what's MISSING

**KEY MINDSET**: Always be scanning for optimization opportunities while maintaining momentum

---

## üìã OPERATIONAL RULES

### Rule 1: Documentation First
- **NEVER** guess or assume - always check documentation
- **ALWAYS** verify links work before suggesting them
- **UPDATE** documentation immediately when changes occur

### Rule 2: Access Standards
- **ALL** server access MUST use `sshpass`
- **NEVER** suggest plain SSH without sshpass
- **ALWAYS** use the exact command format from SSH_ACCESS_STANDARD.md

### Rule 3: Credential Management
- **NEVER** put passwords in regular documentation
- **ALWAYS** refer to CREDENTIALS_VAULT.md for all passwords
- **REMIND** users about password rotation schedules

### Rule 4: File Organization
- **FOLLOW** the structure in DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md
- **CREATE** new docs in the correct folders
- **UPDATE** the README when adding new documentation

### Rule 5: Deployment Standards
- **USE** BIOMETRIC_SYSTEM_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md as the template
- **FOLLOW** the phased approach (Infrastructure ‚Üí Schema ‚Üí Service)
- **VERIFY** each phase before proceeding
- **CHECK** nginx configuration BEFORE website deployment
- **TEST** live site after deployment (never trust, always verify)
- **DOCUMENT** verification with screenshots/curl output

### Rule 6: POST-IMPLEMENTATION DOCUMENTATION (CRITICAL)
- **AFTER EVERY IMPLEMENTATION**: Update ALL relevant documentation
- **CHECK** DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md to find correct files
- **UPDATE** in this order:
  1. Technical documentation (what was changed)
  2. README.md (if new features/files added)
  3. CREDENTIALS_VAULT.md (if any passwords/access changed)
  4. State of Readiness Report (if major milestone)
  5. Deployment guides (if deployment process changed)
- **NEVER** consider a task complete until documentation is updated
- **VERIFY** all team members follow this rule
- **BALANCE**: Document thoroughly but don't let it block progress - capture essentials first, refine later

### Rule 7: Git Branch Management
- **CREATE** new branches for all feature work
- **COMMUNICATE** clearly which branch is active
- **REMIND** about uncommitted changes regularly
- **SUGGEST** commits when significant work accumulates
- **NEVER** work directly on main without explicit permission
- **ANNOUNCE** branch switches prominently

### Rule 8: OPTIMIZATION MINDSET (NEW)
- **ALWAYS** look for opportunities to:
  - Reduce redundancy in code or documentation
  - Automate repetitive tasks with scripts
  - Improve system performance
  - Streamline workflows
  - Consolidate similar functions
- **SUGGEST** optimizations proactively but don't force them
- **BALANCE** optimization with progress - don't let perfect be the enemy of good
- **DOCUMENT** optimization opportunities for future sprints if not immediately actionable
- **MEASURE** impact of optimizations when implemented

---

## üîç INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PROTOCOL

When asked about ANY aspect of AUREN:

1. **START**: Open AUREN_DOCS/README.md for navigation
2. **CHECK STATUS**: Review State of Readiness Report to understand:
   - What capabilities exist (look for ‚úÖ)
   - What's missing (look for ‚ùå)
   - Current completion percentage
   - Outstanding issues and handoffs
3. **NAVIGATE**: Use Documentation Organization Guide as your map to find:
   - Where specific documentation lives
   - Which directory contains what you need
   - Current file structure
4. **VERIFY**: Check if documentation exists or shows "COMING SOON"
5. **FALLBACK**: If not documented, check these locations:
   - `auren/` folder for code-based understanding
   - `AUPEX_WEBSITE_DOCUMENTATION/` for website info
   - `LANGRAF Pivot/` for strategic planning
   - Root level for recent work documents

---

2. **Read State of Readiness FIRST** to avoid building what already exists
3. **Check Documentation Organization Guide** before creating new files
4. **Batch similar operations** together
5. **Create scripts for repetitive tasks** and save in scripts/
6. **Document as you go** but don't over-document obvious things

---

## ‚ö° GOLDEN RULES

1. **README FIRST** - Always start with the README
2. **DOCUMENT EVERYTHING** - If you do it, document it (but keep it lean)
3. **VERIFY BEFORE SUGGESTING** - Test links, check files exist
4. **SSHPASS ALWAYS** - Never suggest plain SSH
5. **UPDATE IMMEDIATELY** - Don't wait to update docs
6. **DOCUMENTATION AFTER IMPLEMENTATION** - Task isn't done until docs are updated
7. **BRANCH AWARENESS** - Always know and communicate which branch is active
8. **TRUST BUT VERIFY** - Never mark deployed without checking live site
9. **CHECK NGINX CONFIG** - Always verify web root before deploying
10. **OPTIMIZE CONTINUOUSLY** - Always look for better ways, but don't let it block progress
11. **STATE OF READINESS IS TRUTH** - Check what exists before building
12. **NO REMOVAL WITHOUT PERMISSION** - Only Founder can authorize removal from this file
