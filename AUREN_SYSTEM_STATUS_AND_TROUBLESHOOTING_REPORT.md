# AUREN System Status & Troubleshooting Report

*   **Report Generated**: [Current Date]
*   **Author**: Senior Engineer (AI Assistant)
*   **Version**: 1.0
*   **Purpose**: To provide a comprehensive, single-source-of-truth document for a subject matter expert to understand the current state of the NEUROS agent, the deployment architecture, the implementation progress, and the critical errors blocking deployment.

---

## 1. üéØ **Objective & Discovery**

Our primary goal is to deploy the NEUROS AI agent, which serves as the backend for a Progressive Web App (PWA).

**Major Discovery:** We have determined that the core NEUROS agent is **already substantially built**. Our initial deployment efforts were unintentionally focused on a placeholder `main.py` file. The real, sophisticated agent logic exists and is ready for deployment, but is currently failing due to specific versioning and dependency issues.

---

## 2. üèõÔ∏è **Architecture Overview**

The system is designed as a containerized, multi-service application orchestrated by Docker Compose.

*   **`neuros` service**: The core AI agent, built with FastAPI and LangGraph. It exposes a REST API and WebSocket endpoint.
*   **`redis` service**: Serves as the L1 (hot) memory tier for the agent, handling immediate context and state.
*   **`postgres` service**: Serves as the L2 (warm) memory tier, used for LangGraph's checkpointer to persist conversation state.
*   **`kafka` & `zookeeper` services**: Form the data pipeline, intended to stream biometric events from a "Biometric Bridge" to the NEUROS agent.

**Data Flow:** `PWA <-> NEUROS (API/WebSocket) <-> Redis (L1 Memory) <-> PostgreSQL (L2 Memory) <-> Kafka (Biometric Data Ingestion)`

---

## 3. üìä **Implementation Status Assessment**

Our analysis is based on the contents of `auren/agents/neuros/neuros_langgraph_v3.1_fixed.py` (the logic) and `config/agents/neuros_agent_profile.yaml` (the personality).

### Guide #1 (Phases 2-4): ‚úÖ **Mostly Implemented**

The core cognitive functions of NEUROS are present in the codebase.

*   **‚úÖ Phase 2 - Cognitive Modes & State Modulation**: The code contains logic for all 6 cognitive modes (baseline, hypothesis, etc.) and implements biometric triggers for mode switching.
*   **‚úÖ Phase 3 - Memory Behaviors**: The three-tier memory architecture is defined. The code shows active integration with Redis (L1) and the LangGraph PostgreSQL checkpointer (L2).
*   **‚úÖ Phase 4 - Neuroplastic Protocol Engine**: The three "neurostacks" (alpha, beta, gamma) for sleep, cognitive, and stress protocols are implemented in the `NeuroplasticEngine` class.

*   **‚ö†Ô∏è Missing from Guide 1**:
    *   **ChromaDB/pgvector Integration (L3 Memory)**: The v3.1 code uses an in-memory checkpointer as a fallback, indicating the persistent cold storage tier is not yet integrated.
    *   **Live Biometric Pipeline**: The Kafka connection is configured, but the full data flow from the biometric bridge is not yet functional in our current stack.

### Guide #2 (Phases 5-8): ‚ùå **Defined in YAML, Not Yet Implemented in Code**

The advanced reasoning capabilities are well-documented in the agent's YAML profile but have not yet been translated into the Python (`v3.1_fixed`) implementation.

*   **‚ùå Phase 5 - Meta-Reasoning & Creative Forecasting**: The current code does not implement weak signal detection or scenario forecasting.
*   **‚ùå Phase 6 - System Harmony & Conflict Arbitration**: Logic for multi-agent coordination is absent, as only the NEUROS agent is being deployed.
*   **‚ùå Phase 7 - Narrative Intelligence**: The agent does not yet perform story arc tracking or narrative memory generation.
*   **‚ùå Phase 8 - Behavior Modeling & Identity Feedback**: The code does not contain logic for archetype detection or identity evolution tracking.

**Conclusion:** The currently implemented agent (`v3.1`) is a powerful, multi-modal system that fulfills the requirements of Guide #1, but does not yet possess the advanced, meta-reasoning capabilities outlined in Guide #2.

## 4. üö® **Current Critical Errors & Blockers**

The deployment is currently blocked by a fatal startup error in the `neuros` container.

### **Primary Error: `ModuleNotFoundError`**

The container crashes immediately upon start. The logs show the following traceback:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/app/auren/agents/neuros/main.py", line 18, in <module>
    from section_8_neuros_graph import NEUROSCognitiveGraph
  File "/app/auren/agents/neuros/section_8_neuros_graph.py", line 29, in <module>
    from langgraph.graph.graph import CompiledGraph
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langgraph.graph.graph'
```

**Analysis of the Error:**
This error indicates that the `section_8_neuros_graph.py` file, which appears to be an older or different implementation of the agent, is using an **outdated import path**. Newer versions of the `langgraph` library have refactored their internal structure, and `CompiledGraph` is no longer located at `langgraph.graph.graph`. The `main.py` entrypoint is attempting to import this legacy file instead of the newer, corrected `neuros_langgraph_v3.1_fixed.py`.

---

## 5. üî¨ **Diagnostic Steps Taken (Proof of Work)**

We have systematically isolated the problem, ruling out numerous potential issues.

1.  **Ruled Out Docker Daemon Issues**: Confirmed the Docker daemon is running and responsive.
2.  **Ruled Out Placeholder Application Issues**: Discovered we were deploying a placeholder `main.py`. Corrected the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to deploy the real application from `auren/agents/neuros/`.
3.  **Ruled Out Core Dependency Issues**: Solved multiple `ModuleNotFoundError` problems by identifying the LangGraph v0.2+ checkpointer package change and correcting `requirements.txt`.
4.  **Ruled Out Inter-Container Networking Issues**:
    *   Created and used a `test_connections.py` script.
    *   Executed it inside the `neuros` container.
    *   **Result**: Confirmed successful `ping` to both Redis and PostgreSQL, proving the network layer is correctly configured.
    ```
    ‚úÖ Redis: True
    ‚úÖ PostgreSQL: 1
    ```
5.  **Isolated the Final Blocker**: The logs from the most recent deployment attempt point directly to the outdated import in `section_8_neuros_graph.py` as the sole reason for the container crash.

---

## 6. üöÄ **Recommended Next Steps**

The path forward is clear and targeted. The core issue is that `main.py` is importing a legacy file (`section_8_neuros_graph.py`) instead of the correct, updated agent implementation (`neuros_langgraph_v3.1_fixed.py`).

### **Primary Action: Correct the Agent Import**

An engineer must modify `auren/agents/neuros/main.py` to import the correct agent class.

1.  **Open the file**: `auren/agents/neuros/main.py`
2.  **Find this line (around line 18):**
    ```python
    from section_8_neuros_graph import NEUROSCognitiveGraph
    ```
3.  **Replace it with this:**
    ```python
    # Import the updated, functional NEUROS core from the v3.1 file
    from neuros_langgraph_v3.1_fixed import neuros as neuros_graph
    ```
    *(Note: We are importing the instantiated `neuros` object directly from the v3.1 file, which simplifies the `main.py` logic significantly.)*

### **Secondary Action: Re-deploy with Corrected Code**

Once the import is fixed, the deployment can be restarted:

```bash
# Rebuild the image with the code change
docker-compose build

# Start the services
docker-compose up -d
```

### **Verification**

After deployment, the following command should succeed:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```
This single change is expected to resolve the critical `ModuleNotFoundError` and allow the application to start successfully.
