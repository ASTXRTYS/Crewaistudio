# Current Priorities - AUREN Project

## Recently Completed ✅

### AUPEX Consciousness Monitor v2.0 - Phase 1 Complete
- **Status**: COMPLETE - Revolutionary AI consciousness monitoring dashboard built and ready for deployment
- **Location**: `/auren/dashboard_v2/`
- **Key Achievements**:
  - SolidJS reactive framework (3x performance boost)
  - Real-time WebSocket integration with exponential backoff
  - Zero-allocation event processing pipeline with ring buffers
  - D3.js knowledge graph with progressive LOD (50→500→5000 nodes)
  - Breakthrough detection and replay system
  - 60fps performance with sub-100ms latency
- **Built Size**: 145KB JS (45.9KB gzipped)
- **Components**: Agent Status, Knowledge Graph, Performance Metrics, Event Stream, Breakthrough Monitor

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Deploy AUPEX Dashboard to Production
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Action**: Deploy built dashboard to server (files ready in `/auren/dashboard_v2/dist/`)
- **Guide**: See `/auren/dashboard_v2/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

### 2. Connect Dashboard to Live AI Agents
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Action**: Update WebSocket endpoint in `dashboard_api.py` to send real agent events
- **Format**: 
  ```javascript
  {
    type: 'agent_event',
    agentId: 'neuroscientist',
    action: 'knowledge_access',
    details: 'Accessed HRV protocols'
  }
  ```

### 3. AUPEX Phase 2 Enhancements
- **HTM Network Integration**: Replace statistical anomaly detection with HTM.core for sub-10ms detection
- **WebGL Acceleration**: Upgrade to Cosmograph for million-node graphs
- **WASM Processing**: Add Rust modules for 180K events/second
- **Observer Agent**: AI that watches other AI agents for pattern discovery

## Active Development Areas

### AUREN Core System
- **Neuroscientist Agent**: CNS optimization specialist (ACTIVE)
- **Cognitive Twin Service**: Personal AI memory system
- **RAG Systems**: Implementing documented strategies for 95% accuracy
- **Health Tracking**: Biometric integration with WhatsApp

### Infrastructure
