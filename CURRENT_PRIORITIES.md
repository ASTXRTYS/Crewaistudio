> **Development Phase**: Infrastructure Complete, Dashboard-Memory Integration Phase

## üéØ IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (This Weekend - By Sunday Morning)

### 1. Connect Dashboard to Real Memory System (TODAY - 6 hours)
**Goal**: Make the knowledge graph show actual AI memories, not demo data
- [x] Implement Knowledge Graph API endpoint
- [x] Update dashboard to fetch real memories
- [x] Add WebSocket events for live updates
- [ ] Test with neuroscientist agent queries
**Deliverable**: Dashboard showing real AI thinking in real-time

### 2. Agent Card System Architecture (TODAY - 4 hours)
**Goal**: Create modular agent-focused interface instead of overwhelming single dashboard
- [ ] Design agent card component structure
- [ ] Create neuroscientist-specific card with:
  - [ ] Personal knowledge graph (cluster view)
  - [ ] Active hypotheses display
  - [ ] Accuracy metrics
  - [ ] Domain-specific insights (HRV, sleep, recovery)
- [ ] Implement tab/navigation system for multiple agents
- [ ] Make current dashboard the "Observatory View" for MVP testing

**Why This Matters**: 
- Reduces sensory overload
- Increases user engagement through exploration
- Each agent becomes a "character" users connect with
- Drives dopamine through discovering insights per agent

### 3. UI Agent Implementation (Sunday - 4 hours)

## üîß Technical Implementation Notes

### Agent Card Router
```python
# In auren/api/dashboard_api.py
@app.get("/api/agent/{agent_id}/card-data")
async def get_agent_card_data(agent_id: str):
    """Get all data needed for an agent's card"""
    return {
        "profile": get_agent_profile(agent_id),
        "knowledge_graph": get_agent_knowledge(agent_id),
        "hypotheses": get_agent_hypotheses(agent_id),
        "metrics": get_domain_metrics(agent_id),
        "insights": get_recent_insights(agent_id)
    }
```

### Context Preservation
```python
# In auren/core/agents/ui_agent.py
class UIAgent(BaseAIAgent):
    """Captures all context for future agent use"""
    
    async def process_input(self, user_input: str):
        # Determine relevance to active specialists
        relevant_agents = self.determine_relevance(user_input)
        
        if relevant_agents:
            # Route to specialists
            await self.route_to_agents(user_input, relevant_agents)
        
        # Always store for future reference
        await self.remember(
            content=user_input,
            memory_type=MemoryType.USER_CONTEXT,
            tags=["preserved_context", "ui_agent"]
        )
```

## üìä Success Metrics

## üí° Key Insights

### Why Agent Cards Will Win
1. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: One agent at a time
2. **Increased Exploration**: Natural curiosity about each agent
3. **Personality Connection**: Users bond with individual agents
4. **Dopamine Optimization**: Discoveries per agent = more rewards
5. **Natural Progression**: Start with one, unlock more over time

### The UI Agent Advantage
- No context is ever lost
- New agents can learn from past interactions
- Creates seamless experience as system grows
- Enables cross-agent pattern recognition

## üìù Notes for Implementation

**For Senior Engineer**:
1. Start with the Knowledge Graph Integration Guide
2. Then implement agent card architecture
3. Focus on neuroscientist card first
4. UI agent can be basic for now (just storage)

**Design Principles**:
- Each agent card should feel like meeting a specialist
- Knowledge graphs should be agent-specific, not global
- Hypotheses should be trackable and engaging
- Metrics should be domain-appropriate
