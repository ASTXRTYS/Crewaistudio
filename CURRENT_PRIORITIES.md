## üîß TECHNICAL DEBT TO ADDRESS

### High Priority (Blocking Issues)
1. **Git Branch Confusion**
   - Multiple branches with inconsistent states
   - Secret leak history in some branches
   - Need to consolidate to clean main branch

2. **Python Version Compatibility**
   - CrewAI requires Python 3.10+ but system has 3.9
   - Some scripts fail due to version mismatch
   - Need virtual environment standardization

3. **Database Connection Issues**
   - asyncpg connection string inconsistencies
   - localhost vs 127.0.0.1 vs container networking
   - Need unified connection configuration

### Medium Priority (Performance/Maintenance)
1. **Duplicate Docker Compose Files**
   - `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.yaml` confusion
   - Multiple compose files in different directories
   - Need single source of truth

2. **Incomplete Test Coverage**
   - Three-tier memory system has tests but not comprehensive
   - Agent integration tests missing
   - API endpoint tests needed

3. **Documentation Fragmentation**
   - Multiple overlapping documentation files
   - Some docs reference non-existent features
   - Need consolidated documentation structure

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Code Organization**
   - Some modules in wrong directories (e.g., auren/src/auren)
   - Inconsistent import paths
   - Need refactoring for clarity

2. **Logging & Debugging**
   - Limited logging in memory operations
   - No debug mode for development
   - Need structured logging system

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Hardcoded values in multiple places
   - Environment variables not consistently used
   - Need centralized config system

## üìä Development Metrics

### Current System Capabilities
- **Memory Capacity**: 15 knowledge items loaded
- **Active Agents**: 1 (Neuroscientist)
- **API Endpoints**: 8 functional
- **Services Running**: 7 (Redis, PostgreSQL, ChromaDB, Prometheus, Grafana, 2 exporters)

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Redis Operations**: ~5,000 ops/sec capability
- **Memory Retrieval**: <10ms hot, <50ms warm
- **WebSocket Latency**: <5ms local
- **Storage Used**: ~50MB (will grow with usage)
