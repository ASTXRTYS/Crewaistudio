- **After**: Time-series charts, anomaly detection, real-time biometric monitoring

### User Experience
- **Before**: Static interface
- **After**: Rich micro-interactions, smooth animations, responsive feedback

### Performance
- **Before**: Basic WebSocket connection
- **After**: Enhanced WebSocket with heartbeat, reconnection, and message queueing

### Accessibility
- **Before**: Limited accessibility considerations
- **After**: WCAG AA compliant, reduced motion support, high contrast modes
