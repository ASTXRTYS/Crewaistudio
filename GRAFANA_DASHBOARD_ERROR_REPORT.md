# üö® CRITICAL: Grafana Dashboard Error Report

**To**: Executive Engineer  
**From**: Senior Engineer  
**Date**: January 28, 2025  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Impact**: All Grafana dashboards non-functional

---

## üìã Executive Summary

All Grafana dashboards are displaying "server error, server misbehaving" due to a cascade of failures:
1. **Prometheus container is DOWN** (exited 22 minutes ago)
2. **Metrics endpoint returns 500 error** due to missing import
3. **Grafana cannot query metrics** because Prometheus is not running

---

## üîç Detailed Investigation Findings

### 1. Dashboard Status
All six dashboards report server errors:
- ‚úó AUREN AI Agent Memory Tier Visualization
- ‚úó Memory Tier Operations Real-Time
- ‚úó AUREN System Health and Performance
- ‚úó AUREN System Overview
- ‚úó Webhook and Event Processing
- ‚úó Cognitive Mode Analytics

### 2. Root Cause Analysis

#### Primary Issue: Prometheus Container Exited
```
Container: auren-prometheus
Status: Exited (0) 22 minutes ago
Last log: "Received an OS signal, exiting gracefully... signal=terminated"
```

#### Secondary Issue: Metrics Endpoint Broken
```python
# Error in /app/complete_biometric_system.py line 1082
NameError: name 'Response' is not defined
```

The metrics endpoint returns HTTP 500 Internal Server Error because:
- Missing import: `from fastapi import Response`
- The code uses `Response(generate_latest(), media_type=CONTENT_TYPE_LATEST)`
- But `Response` class is not imported

### 3. Network Configuration Status
‚úì Grafana is running (container: auren-grafana)  
‚úì Grafana is on correct network (auren-network)  
‚úì Datasource configured correctly (http://auren-prometheus:9090)  
‚úó Prometheus is not running  
‚úó Metrics endpoint is broken  

### 4. Current State
- **API Health**: Degraded (postgres, kafka_consumer, and other components down)
- **Metrics Collection**: None (0 bytes returned from /metrics)
- **Dashboard Queries**: All failing with "server misbehaving"

---

## üéØ Hypothesis on Root Causes

### Why Prometheus Exited
1. **Manual Stop**: Someone ran `docker stop auren-prometheus`
2. **System Restart**: Docker daemon restarted and container not set to restart
3. **Resource Constraints**: OOM killer or disk space issues
4. **Configuration Error**: Invalid scrape config causing exit

### Why Metrics Endpoint Broke
1. **Incomplete Fix**: When fixing the metrics endpoint, the Response import was missed
2. **Wrong Import Path**: FastAPI Response should be imported from `fastapi` not `starlette`
3. **Testing Gap**: Metrics endpoint wasn't tested after the fix was applied

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Proposed Resolution Thesis

### Immediate Fixes (5 minutes)

#### 1. Fix Metrics Endpoint
```python
# Add missing import to complete_biometric_system.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Response, Request, BackgroundTasks
from prometheus_client import generate_latest, CONTENT_TYPE_LATEST

# The get_metrics function should work after adding Response import
@app.get("/metrics")
async def get_metrics():
    return Response(generate_latest(), media_type=CONTENT_TYPE_LATEST)
```

#### 2. Restart Prometheus
```bash
# Start Prometheus container
docker start auren-prometheus

# Verify it's running
docker ps | grep prometheus

# Check if it can scrape targets
curl http://144.126.215.218:9090/api/v1/targets
```

### Medium-term Fixes (30 minutes)

#### 3. Add Container Restart Policies
```yaml
# Update docker-compose.yml
services:
  prometheus:
    restart: unless-stopped  # Add this
  
  grafana:
    restart: unless-stopped  # Add this
```

#### 4. Implement Health Checks
```yaml
# Add health checks to detect failures early
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "wget", "--spider", "-q", "http://localhost:9090/-/ready"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
```

### Long-term Improvements

#### 5. Custom Metrics Implementation
The dashboards expect custom AUREN metrics that don't exist yet:
- `auren_webhook_requests_total`
- `auren_memory_tier_operations_total`
- `auren_neuros_mode_switches_total`
- etc.

These need to be implemented in the API code as defined in the enhanced_api_metrics.py blueprint.

---

## üìä Validation Steps

After fixes are applied:

1. **Verify Prometheus is running**:
   ```bash
   docker ps | grep prometheus
   curl http://144.126.215.218:9090/api/v1/targets
   ```

2. **Verify metrics endpoint works**:
   ```bash
   curl http://144.126.215.218:8888/metrics | grep "# HELP"
   ```

3. **Test Grafana datasource**:
   - Go to Grafana ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí Data Sources
   - Click "Prometheus"
   - Click "Test" button
   - Should show "Data source is working"

4. **Check dashboards**:
   - Open any dashboard
   - Queries should return data (even if limited to basic metrics)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment

**If not fixed immediately**:
- No visibility into system performance
- Cannot detect issues proactively
- Dashboards remain broken for demos
- Team cannot monitor the enhanced features

**Time to fix**: 10-15 minutes for immediate fixes

---

## üé¨ Recommended Action Plan

1. **NOW**: Fix the Response import in biometric API
2. **NOW**: Restart Prometheus container
3. **TODAY**: Add restart policies to prevent future exits
4. **THIS WEEK**: Implement custom metrics for full dashboard functionality

---

## üìé Additional Context

The enhanced dashboards were created successfully and are waiting for data:
- 4 new dashboards created via API
- All dashboard JSON definitions are valid
- Queries are correct but need metrics to exist
- Basic instrumentation is working (FastAPI instrumentator)

The infrastructure is ready; we just need to:
1. Fix the simple import error
2. Restart the stopped container
3. Implement the custom metrics
