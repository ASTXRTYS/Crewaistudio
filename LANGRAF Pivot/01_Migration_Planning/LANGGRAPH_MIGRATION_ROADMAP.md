# LANGGRAPH MIGRATION ROADMAP

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the systematic migration of AUREN from CrewAI to LangGraph, leveraging the successful biometric bridge implementation as our proven pattern. The migration will be executed in phases to minimize risk and ensure continuous operation.

2. **Improve response times to <100ms** for state operations
3. **Enable true event-driven architecture** with biometric triggers
4. **Achieve horizontal scalability** for 1000+ concurrent users
5. **Implement time-travel debugging** for hypothesis testing

## ðŸ”„ Migration Order Rationale

### Why This Order?

1. **Biometric Bridge First** âœ…
   - Proves LangGraph patterns work
   - No existing CrewAI dependencies
   - Clear success metrics

2. **Memory System Second**
   - Foundation for all agents
   - Already event-driven (easy port)
   - Enables state persistence

3. **Agents Third**
   - Depend on memory system
   - Can migrate incrementally
   - Each agent is isolated

4. **Infrastructure Fourth**
   - Requires stable agent layer
   - High risk, high reward
   - Can run in parallel

---

## ðŸš§ Dependencies & Blockers

### Critical Dependencies
1. **LangGraph Expertise**
   - Need team training on LangGraph patterns
   - Checkpoint management knowledge
   - State design best practices

2. **GPU Infrastructure**
   - 8x A100 GPUs for vLLM
   - Kubernetes cluster setup
   - Model deployment pipeline

3. **API Access**
   - Oura API credentials
   - WHOOP API partnership
   - WhatsApp Business verification

### Potential Blockers
1. **CrewAI Tight Coupling**
   - Some agents may have deep CrewAI dependencies
   - Custom CrewAI features without LangGraph equivalent
   - Mitigation: Wrapper pattern for gradual migration

2. **State Migration Complexity**
   - Large existing state in CrewAI format
   - Mitigation: Dual-write period with reconciliation

3. **Performance Regression**
   - Initial LangGraph implementation may be slower
   - Mitigation: Performance testing at each phase

## ðŸ“Š Resource Requirements

### Team Allocation
- **2 Senior Engineers**: Full-time on migration
- **1 DevOps Engineer**: Infrastructure setup
- **1 QA Engineer**: Testing each phase
- **1 Product Manager**: Coordination

### Infrastructure Needs

- **GPUs**: 8x A100 for LLM deployment
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced observability stack

### Budget Estimate
- **Infrastructure**: $50K (one-time)
- **Operational**: $5K/month (ongoing)
- **Total 10-week cost**: $100K
- **ROI**: 82% cost reduction = payback in 3 months

## ðŸ”„ Rollback Procedures

Each phase includes rollback capability:

1. **Feature Flags**: Toggle between CrewAI/LangGraph
2. **Dual Running**: Both systems active during migration
3. **Data Sync**: Continuous sync until cutover
4. **Traffic Control**: Gradual migration with instant rollback

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring & Metrics

Track these KPIs throughout migration:

1. **Response Time**: Target <100ms (from 200ms)
2. **Cost per Request**: Target $0.002 (from $0.01)
3. **Uptime**: Maintain 99.9%
4. **User Satisfaction**: No degradation
5. **Error Rate**: <0.1%
