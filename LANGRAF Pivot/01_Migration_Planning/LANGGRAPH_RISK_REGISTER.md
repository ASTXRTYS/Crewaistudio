- **Mitigation**:
  - Weekly budget reviews
  - Phased migration approach
  - Clear go/no-go checkpoints
  - Reserved contingency budget
- **Owner**: Project Manager
- **Status**: Budget tracking active

### 9. Schedule Slippage
- **Likelihood**: High
- **Impact**: Minor
- **Description**: 10-week timeline might be optimistic
- **Mitigation**:
  - Buffer time in each phase
  - Parallel workstreams where possible
  - Daily standups for blockers
  - Flexible scope prioritization
- **Owner**: Project Manager
- **Status**: Schedule monitoring active

### 10. Testing Overhead
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: Minor
- **Description**: Comprehensive testing might slow development
- **Mitigation**:
  - Automated testing focus
  - Risk-based testing approach
  - Dedicated QA resources
  - Testing in parallel with development
- **Owner**: QA Lead
- **Status**: Test strategy defined

## 🔄 Rollback Procedures

### Level 1: Feature Rollback
```python
# Feature flag for instant rollback
if ENABLE_LANGGRAPH:
    result = langgraph_implementation()
else:
    result = crewai_implementation()
```

### Level 2: Service Rollback
```bash
# Blue-green deployment rollback
kubectl set image deployment/auren auren=auren:crewai-stable
kubectl rollout status deployment/auren
```

### Level 3: Data Rollback
```sql
-- Restore from pre-migration backup
BEGIN;
TRUNCATE langgraph_states;
INSERT INTO langgraph_states SELECT * FROM backup.langgraph_states_premigration;
COMMIT;
```

### Level 4: Complete Rollback
1. Stop all LangGraph services
2. Restore CrewAI services from backup
3. Restore database to pre-migration snapshot
4. Update DNS/load balancer
5. Notify all stakeholders
