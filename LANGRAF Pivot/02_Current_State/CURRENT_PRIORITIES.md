│   └── neuroscientist.js  # Agent dashboard logic
└── public/                # Static assets (future)
```

#### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no build process needed)
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js (loaded via CDN)
- **Charts**: Canvas API (custom implementation)
- **Animations**: CSS animations + JavaScript
- **Data**: Ready for WebSocket integration

#### Key Design Patterns:

1. **Color Scheme** (XAI-inspired):
   ```css
   --bg-primary: #000000;      /* Deep space black */
   --accent-blue: #00D9FF;     /* Electric blue */
   --accent-purple: #9945FF;   /* Neon purple */
   --accent-green: #00FF88;    /* Success green */
   ```

2. **3D Visualizations**:
   - Particle systems use Three.js BufferGeometry
   - Knowledge graph uses force-directed layout
   - Mouse interaction for rotation/zoom

3. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Charts update via requestAnimationFrame
   - WebSocket hooks prepared in neuroscientist.js
   - Simulated data for demo purposes

#### How to Add New Pages:

1. **Create HTML file** in appropriate directory
2. **Link to main.css** for consistent styling
3. **Add navigation** using the standard nav structure
4. **Include Three.js** if using 3D elements

Example new page template:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Page Title - AUREN</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../styles/main.css">
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <nav class="main-nav"><!-- Standard nav --></nav>
    <!-- Your content -->
    <script src="../js/your-page.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Deployment:
1. Make changes locally in `auren/dashboard_v2/`
2. Run `./deploy_new_website.sh` to deploy
3. Changes are live immediately (no build process)

#### Server Configuration:
- **Nginx**: Serves static files from `/usr/share/nginx/html`
- **Docker**: Volume mapped to `./auren/dashboard_v2`
- **API Proxy**: `/api/*` routes to FastAPI backend
- **WebSocket**: `/ws` endpoint ready for real-time
