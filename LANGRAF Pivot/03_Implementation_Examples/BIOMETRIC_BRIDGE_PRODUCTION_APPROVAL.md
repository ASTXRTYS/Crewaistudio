## Minor Follow-ups (Non-Blocking)

### 1. Webhook Retry Queue (v2.1)
- **Priority**: High for v2.1
- **Purpose**: Handle rate limiting more gracefully
- **Timeline**: Q2 Week 1-2

### 2. Circuit Breaker Pattern (v2.1)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Purpose**: Protect external API integrations
- **Timeline**: Q2 Week 3

### 3. Metric Namespacing
- **Priority**: Pre-production
- **Action**: Apply "auren_" prefix to all metrics
- **Timeline**: Before deployment
