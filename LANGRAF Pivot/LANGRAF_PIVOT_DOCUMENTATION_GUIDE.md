## üéØ Purpose of This Folder

This folder serves as the **single source of truth** for AUREN's architectural evolution from CrewAI to LangGraph. It documents:

1. **Why** - The limitations that drove the pivot
2. **What** - The specific implementations and patterns
3. **How** - The migration strategy and execution
4. **When** - The timeline and phases
5. **Results** - Proof of successful implementations

## üìä Success Metrics

Track these metrics as we progress:
- ‚úÖ First LangGraph implementation (Biometric Bridge) - COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Production-ready biometric system (1,796 lines) - COMPLETE
- [ ] Memory system integration with LangGraph
- [ ] Multi-agent orchestration migration
- [ ] Performance improvements documented
- [ ] Cost reduction achieved (target: 82-88%)

## üîÑ Document Maintenance

This folder should be updated:
- After each successful LangGraph component implementation
- When new patterns or best practices are discovered
- Before and after each migration phase
- When production metrics become available
