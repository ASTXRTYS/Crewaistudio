## 🏗️ **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW**

### **What You're Implementing (60% of YAML Spec):**

#### ✅ **Phase 1-3: Core Cognitive Architecture (95% Complete)**
```python
# 5 Cognitive Modes with Intelligent Switching:
- baseline: Default observation (for status checks)
- reflex: Emergency response (HRV < 25ms)
- hypothesis: Complex analysis (default for deep queries)
- companion: Low-output support (for greetings)
- sentinel: High-alert monitoring (biometric flags)

# 3-Tier Memory System:
- Hot (Redis): <24h, millisecond access for personalization
- Warm (PostgreSQL): 30 days, structured queries
- Cold (ChromaDB): Forever, semantic search

# Request Classification:
- simple_greeting → companion mode → <100ms
- status_check → baseline mode → <500ms  
- complex_analysis → hypothesis mode → 2-5s
```

#### ✅ **Phase 4: Neuroplastic Protocol Stacks (70% Complete)**
```python
# Pre-built optimization programs:
- neurostack_alpha: Sleep latency reset (7 days)
- neurostack_beta: Mid-day cognitive surge (5 days)
- neurostack_gamma: Stress recoding loop (10 days)
```

#### ✅ **Phase 10: Autonomous Mission Generation (80% Complete)**
```python
# 5 Mission Types:
- clarity_reboot: When energy is flat
- push_phase_initiation: When ready for next level
- introspection_mission: For reflection periods
- circadian_lockdown: For sleep optimization
- cognitive_burnout_flush: For overstimulation
```

#### ✅ **Phase 11: Narrative Intelligence (60% Complete)**
```python
# User Archetype Tracking:
- the_analyst: Data-driven seeker
- the_warrior: Grit over mood
- the_sentinel: Guarding discipline
- the_restorer: Healing-focused
```

#### ✅ **Phase 13: Pre-Symptom Detection (70% Complete)**
```python
# Early Warning System (48-72 hours):
- HRV microtrend analysis
- Sleep architecture compression detection
- Motivation drift monitoring
- Intervention suggestions before symptoms appear
```

```

### **PHASE 4: Service Restart & Validation** *(15 minutes)*

#### 4.1 Restart NEUROS Container
```bash
# Install new dependencies:
pip install -r /app/requirements.txt

# Restart NEUROS service:
docker restart neuros-advanced

# Wait for startup:
sleep 30

# Check container status:
docker ps | grep neuros
docker logs neuros-advanced --tail 20
```

#### 4.2 Health Check Validation

# Enhanced health check (should show new architecture):
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health | jq .

# Expected response should include:
# - "service": "neuros-cognitive-architecture"
# - "cognitive_modes": ["baseline", "reflex", "hypothesis", "companion", "sentinel"]
# - "memory_tiers": ["hot", "warm", "cold"]
# - "expected_response_times": {...}
```

#### 4.3 Performance Testing
```bash
# Test 1: Simple greeting (expect <100ms)
time curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/agents/neuros/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "hello",
    "user_id": "test_user",
    "session_id": "test_session"
  }' | jq .

# Run the existing monitoring script to verify all services:
/root/monitor-auren.sh

# All services should show as healthy
# NEUROS should show new architecture features
```

#### 6.2 Performance Metrics Collection
```bash
# Document actual response times achieved:
echo "=== NEUROS COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE PERFORMANCE ===" > /tmp/neuros_performance.log
echo "Deployment Date: $(date)" >> /tmp/neuros_performance.log
echo "" >> /tmp/neuros_performance.log

# Test and log each interaction type:

## 🚨 **RISK MITIGATION & ROLLBACK**

### **If Deployment Fails:**
```bash
# IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK PROCEDURE:
# 1. Stop new container:
docker stop neuros-advanced

# 2. Restore backup:
cp neuros_advanced_reasoning_simple.py.backup_[TIMESTAMP] neuros_advanced_reasoning_simple.py

# 3. Restart with original:
docker start neuros-advanced

# 4. Verify health:
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# 5. Document failure and investigate
```

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**
1. **Import Errors**: Verify all dependencies installed correctly
2. **Redis Connection**: Check Redis container health, graceful degradation should work
3. **Memory Issues**: Monitor container resources, code includes memory optimization
4. **Performance Regression**: Verify request classification working correctly

### **Monitoring Points:**
- Container memory usage should remain stable
- Response times should improve dramatically
- Error logs should show no critical failures
- User experience should be immediate and responsive
