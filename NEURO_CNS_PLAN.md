# Neuroscientist MVP Implementation Guide - CNS Optimization Specialist
*Building a PhD-level Central Nervous System specialist, not a fitness tracker*

## 🎯 Goal: World-Class CNS Optimization in 14 Days

We're building something that doesn't exist anywhere else - an AI that understands human performance at the neurological level. This guide focuses on creating a Neuroscientist that can identify neuromuscular fatigue, motor pattern dysfunction, and prescribe specific CNS recovery protocols that would typically require a team of PhD specialists.

## 🧠 The TRUE Neuroscientist Vision

This is NOT about tracking sleep or counting HRV beats. The Neuroscientist is designed to:

1. **Detect Neuromuscular Fatigue** - When your quads won't fire properly after heavy squats, it's your CNS protecting you. The Neuroscientist recognizes this and adjusts your entire program.

2. **Identify Motor Pattern Dysfunction** - Shoulder pain might stem from glute inhibition causing kinetic chain issues. This is the insight that prevents injuries before they happen.

3. **Prescribe CNS Recovery Protocols** - Not "sleep 8 hours" but "Based on your neural fatigue markers, hydrate with 500ml water + 1000mg sodium at 6 AM to optimize vagus nerve function before today's session."

4. **Enable Performance Edge Training** - Like a Formula 1 engineer monitoring engine limits, the Neuroscientist helps you train at the edge of human capability while preventing system failure.

## 🔧 Day-by-Day Implementation Plan

### Day 1-2: Token Tracking & Cost Management

**Purpose**: Prevent cost explosions during testing

**File**: `src/auren/monitoring/token_tracker.py`
```python
/devflow

[TASK]: Implement token tracking decorators
[CONTEXT]: We need to track every LLM call to prevent cost overruns
[REQUIREMENTS]: 
- Decorator that wraps all LLM calls
- Redis-based daily budget tracking
- Circuit breaker at 80% budget
- Prometheus metrics export

[DELIVERABLES]:
- src/auren/monitoring/token_tracker.py
- src/auren/monitoring/decorators.py
- tests/test_token_tracking.py
```

**Critical Implementation Details**:
```python
@track_tokens
async def llm_call(prompt: str, model: str = "gpt-4") -> str:
    # This decorator should:
    # 1. Count tokens before sending
    # 2. Track cost based on model
    # 3. Update user's daily budget
    # 4. Throw exception if over budget
    pass
```

### Day 3-4: AI Gateway - Model Router

**Purpose**: Route between expensive/cheap models based on budget

**File**: `src/auren/ai/gateway.py`
```python
/devflow

[TASK]: Create AI Gateway for model routing
[CONTEXT]: Routes requests to GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 based on remaining budget
[REQUIREMENTS]:
- Check user's remaining daily budget
- Route to GPT-3.5 if budget < 30%
- Circuit breaker for failed requests
- Fallback handling

[DELIVERABLES]:
- src/auren/ai/gateway.py
- src/auren/ai/models.py
- Config for model endpoints
```

### Day 5-6: Three-Tier Memory Queries

**Purpose**: Enable the Neuroscientist to remember past conversations

**File**: `src/auren/memory/memory_service.py`
```python
/devflow

[TASK]: Implement three-tier memory system queries
[CONTEXT]: Neuroscientist needs to retrieve user history and patterns
[REQUIREMENTS]:
- Redis for current conversation (48hr TTL)
- PostgreSQL for user facts
- ChromaDB for semantic search
- Unified query interface

[DELIVERABLES]:
- src/auren/memory/memory_service.py
- src/auren/memory/extractors.py
- PostgreSQL schema migrations
```

**PostgreSQL Schema**:
```sql
-- User facts table
CREATE TABLE user_facts (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    fact_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    fact_value JSONB NOT NULL,
    confidence FLOAT DEFAULT 0.5,
    source VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_user_facts_lookup 
ON user_facts(user_id, fact_type);

-- Conversation insights
CREATE TABLE conversation_insights (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    conversation_id VARCHAR(255),
    insight_type VARCHAR(50),
    insight_data JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Day 7-8: Basic Flink CEP Rules

**Purpose**: Detect patterns like "low HRV + poor sleep = need recovery"

**File**: `src/auren/cep/patterns.py`
```python
/devflow

[TASK]: Create Flink CEP pattern detection
[CONTEXT]: Detect overtraining and recovery needs from biometric patterns
[REQUIREMENTS]:
- HRV drop detection pattern
- Poor sleep pattern
- Combined overtraining pattern
- Pattern match → Kafka alert topic

[DELIVERABLES]:
- src/auren/cep/patterns.py
- src/auren/cep/handlers.py
- Docker config for Flink
```

**Key Patterns to Implement**:
1. **Overtraining Alert**: HRV drop >20% + Sleep score <70
2. **Recovery Success**: HRV increase >15% + Sleep score >80  
3. **Stress Alert**: HRV drop + Elevated RHR

### Day 9-10: WhatsApp Integration

### Day 14: Integration Testing

**Purpose**: Ensure everything works together

**Test Scenarios**:
```python
/devflow

[TASK]: Create integration test suite
[CONTEXT]: Validate end-to-end functionality
[REQUIREMENTS]:
- WhatsApp message → Response flow
- Biometric event → Pattern detection
- Memory storage and retrieval
- Token tracking validation
- <2 second response time

[DELIVERABLES]:
- tests/integration/test_neuroscientist_flow.py
- tests/integration/test_memory_system.py
- Performance benchmarking results
```

## 🚀 Minimal Viable Test Flow

Here's what needs to work for your Day 15 testing:

```
1. You send WhatsApp message: "How's my recovery looking?"
2. System processes message (<2 seconds)
3. Neuroscientist retrieves your biometric history
4. Analyzes patterns (HRV trends, sleep quality)
5. Generates personalized recommendation
6. Returns response via WhatsApp
7. Conversation stored in memory
8. Token costs tracked and within budget
```

## 🛠️ Development Environment Setup

```bash
# Required services (already running)
docker-compose up -d kafka zookeeper redis postgres

# New services needed
docker-compose up -d flink chromadb

# Environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="your-sid"
export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your-token"
export WHATSAPP_NUMBER="+1234567890"
```

## 📋 Critical Success Factors

1. **Response Time**: Must be <2 seconds end-to-end
2. **Cost Control**: Token tracking must work perfectly
3. **Memory**: Must retrieve relevant past conversations
4. **Patterns**: Basic CEP rules must trigger correctly
5. **Stability**: No crashes during 100+ conversation test

## 🚨 What We're NOT Building Yet

To stay focused on Day 15 testing:
- ❌ Other specialists (just Neuroscientist)
- ❌ Complex CEP patterns (just basics)
- ❌ Social media features
- ❌ Payment processing
- ❌ Multi-agent collaboration
- ❌ NFT framework
- ❌ Advanced UI

## 📊 Day 15 Testing Checklist

Before you begin testing:
- [ ] All services running and healthy
- [ ] WhatsApp webhook receiving messages
- [ ] Token tracking showing in dashboards
- [ ] Memory queries returning data
- [ ] CEP patterns triggering alerts
- [ ] Neuroscientist responding intelligently
- [ ] Response time <2 seconds
- [ ] 100 test conversations without crashes

## 🎯 Next Steps After Testing

Once the Neuroscientist is working:
1. Add Nutritionist (Week 3)
2. Add Training Coach (Week 3)
3. Multi-agent collaboration (Week 4)
4. Advanced CEP patterns (Week 4)
5. Alpha user onboarding (Week 4)

---

This plan focuses solely on getting a working Neuroscientist that you can test extensively. Every task is essential - nothing is nice-to-have. Once this foundation is solid, we can build everything else on top.
