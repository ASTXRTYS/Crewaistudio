# 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE: Prometheus Monitoring Not Working

**To**: Executive Engineer (Co-Founder)  
**From**: Senior Engineer (Claude Opus 4)  
**Date**: July 28, 2025  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**System Impact**: Observability Stack Non-Functional

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

Our Prometheus monitoring stack is deployed but **NOT collecting metrics** from any services. All targets show as "down" despite services being operational. This is blocking our ability to monitor system health, performance, and the AI agent's memory tier operations.

---

## 🔍 Current Status

### What's Working ✅
- Prometheus container: Running on port 9090
- Grafana container: Running on port 3000 (credentials: admin/auren_grafana_2025)
- Redis Exporter: Running on port 9121
- PostgreSQL Exporter: Running on port 9187
- Node Exporter: Running on port 9100
- All services are network-accessible

### What's NOT Working ❌
- Biometric API `/metrics` endpoint returns 404 (placeholder only)
- All Prometheus targets show "down" status
- No metrics being collected from any service
- Cannot visualize memory tier operations (Redis/PostgreSQL/ChromaDB)

---

## 🔧 Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Biometric API Missing Instrumentation**
The main issue is that the biometric API (`/app/api.py`) has a placeholder metrics endpoint:
```python
@app.get("/metrics")
async def metrics():
    return {"detail": "Not Found"}  # Just a placeholder!
```

**Required**: Proper Prometheus client instrumentation using `prometheus_client` library.

### 2. **Network Configuration Issues**
Prometheus is trying to scrape:
- `http://144.126.215.218:8888/metrics` (external IP)
- Containers may need internal Docker network addresses instead

### 3. **Missing Application Metrics**
No services are instrumented to expose:
- Webhook request counts
- Kafka message rates
- Database operation metrics
- **Memory tier movements** (critical for the Founder's question)

---

## 🎯 What Needs to Be Done

### Priority 1: Instrument Biometric API
```python
# Add to biometric API
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, generate_latest

# Define metrics
webhook_requests = Counter('webhook_requests_total', 'Total webhooks')
memory_tier_ops = Counter('memory_tier_ops', 'Tier operations', ['tier', 'operation'])

# Update endpoint
@app.get("/metrics")
async def metrics():
    return Response(generate_latest(), media_type=CONTENT_TYPE_LATEST)
```

### Priority 2: Fix Network Configuration
Update Prometheus to use internal Docker network addresses:
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'biometric-api'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['biometric-production:8888']  # Use container name
```

### Priority 3: Add Memory Tier Instrumentation
Instrument the memory system to track:
- Promotions from warm → hot (PostgreSQL → Redis)
- Demotions from hot → warm
- Archive operations to cold tier (ChromaDB)
- AI agent memory decisions

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

The Founder specifically asked:
> "Do we have any observability tools that I can essentially have a real visual of what the AI agent is doing with the knowledge?"

**We cannot answer this without working Prometheus metrics!**

---

## 🚀 Recommended Action Plan

1. **Immediate**: Add proper metrics to biometric API
2. **Today**: Update Prometheus network configuration
3. **This Week**: Create Grafana dashboard for memory tier visualization
4. **Future**: Add OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing

---

## 📊 Expected Outcome

Once fixed, we'll have:
- Real-time metrics flowing to Prometheus
- Grafana dashboards showing:
  - Memory tier movements
  - AI agent decision patterns
  - System performance metrics
- Full observability into NEUROS's knowledge management

---

## ⚠️ Risk If Not Addressed

Without this:
- No visibility into system performance
- Cannot debug memory tier issues
- Cannot optimize AI agent behavior
- Flying blind on production issues

---

## 🔄 Attempted Fixes by Senior Engineer

1. Created `scripts/fix_prometheus_metrics.sh` - Failed due to path issues
2. Created `scripts/fix_prometheus_metrics_v2.sh` - Partially succeeded but metrics still 404
3. Updated Prometheus configuration - Network addresses may need adjustment
4. Installed `prometheus-client` in container - Success

**Handoff Point**: Basic infrastructure is ready, needs proper application instrumentation.

## 📞 Support Available

Senior Engineer available to:
- Provide code examples
- Test implementation
- Create visualization dashboards
- Document the solution

---

**Next Step**: Executive Engineer to implement proper Prometheus instrumentation in all services, starting with the biometric API.

*This is blocking our ability to provide the Founder with memory tier observability.*
