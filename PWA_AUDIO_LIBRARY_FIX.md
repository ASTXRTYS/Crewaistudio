# 🎉 PWA NOW WORKING - Audio Library Fix Complete

## ✅ FINAL WORKING URL: 
```
https://auren-rgj731ekh-jason-madrugas-projects.vercel.app
```

## 🔧 What Was Fixed:

1. **Removed Problematic Audio Libraries**:
   - Uninstalled `react-audio-voice-recorder`
   - Uninstalled `react-audio-visualize`
   - These were causing React 19 compatibility errors

2. **Simplified Input Component**:
   - Removed voice recording functionality (temporarily)
   - Kept text messaging and file upload
   - Fixed all component errors

3. **Added Missing Styles**:
   - Added input bar CSS to App.css
   - Removed styled-jsx dependency
   - Clean, working interface

## 🎯 STEPS TO USE:

### 1. **OPEN THE NEW URL**
```
https://auren-rgj731ekh-jason-madrugas-projects.vercel.app
```

### 2. **ALLOW MIXED CONTENT** (Still Required!)
- Click the **lock icon** in address bar
- Click **"Site settings"**
- Find **"Insecure content"**
- Change to **"Allow"**
- **Refresh the page** (F5)

### 3. **TEST**
- You should see the AUREN interface (no more loading screen)
- Type "Hello NEUROS" and send
- Get sophisticated philosophical response
