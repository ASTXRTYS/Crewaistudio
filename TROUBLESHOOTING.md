# AUREN Dashboard Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status âœ…
- **Website**: http://aupex.ai is responding (200 OK)
- **API**: Health endpoint is working
- **CSS**: Enhanced styles are deployed (backdrop-filter confirmed)
- **Services**: All Docker containers are running

## If the Page Appears Blank or Not Loading:

### 1. Clear Browser Cache (Most Common Fix)
- **Chrome/Edge**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- **Firefox**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- **Safari**: Press `Cmd+Option+R`

### 2. Try Incognito/Private Mode
This bypasses all cache and extensions:
- **Chrome**: `Ctrl+Shift+N` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+N` (Mac)
- **Firefox**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
- **Safari**: `Cmd+Shift+N`

### 3. Check Browser Console for Errors
1. Open Developer Tools: Press `F12` or right-click â†’ "Inspect"
2. Click on the "Console" tab
3. Look for any red error messages
4. Common issues:
   - **CORS errors**: The API might be blocked
   - **404 errors**: Files not found
   - **JavaScript errors**: Code issues

### 4. Test Direct Access
Try these URLs directly:
- API Health: http://aupex.ai/api/health
- CSS File: http://aupex.ai/assets/index-DeySmWur.css
- JS File: http://aupex.ai/assets/index-CTZOFJoO.js

### 5. Check Network Tab
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to "Network" tab
3. Refresh the page
4. Look for failed requests (red entries)

### 6. Disable Browser Extensions
Some extensions can interfere:
1. Try in Incognito mode with extensions disabled
2. Or temporarily disable all extensions

### 7. DNS Cache Issues
Clear your DNS cache:
- **Windows**: `ipconfig /flushdns`
- **Mac**: `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache`
- **Linux**: `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches`

## What You Should See ðŸŽ¨

When the enhanced dashboard loads correctly, you'll see:

1. **Space-themed background** with deep gradient
2. **Glassmorphic panels** with frosted glass effect
3. **Neural particle background** (if enabled)
4. **Glowing elements** with neon accents
5. **Smooth animations** and transitions
6. **Real-time data** updating in the panels

## Quick Test Commands

Run these to verify everything is working:

```bash
# Test if site is up
curl -I http://aupex.ai

# Test API
curl http://aupex.ai/api/health

# Check for glassmorphism CSS
curl -s http://aupex.ai/assets/index-DeySmWur.css | grep -c "backdrop-filter"
```

## Still Not Working?

The deployment was successful and all services are running. The most likely issue is browser caching. Try:

1. **Different browser**: Test in a browser you don't normally use
2. **Different device**: Try on your phone or another computer
3. **Wait 5 minutes**: Sometimes CDN caches need to refresh

The enhanced dashboard IS deployed and working - it's just a matter of getting your browser to load the fresh version!
