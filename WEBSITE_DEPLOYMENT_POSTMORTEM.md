# WEBSITE DEPLOYMENT POST-MORTEM
## Wrong Website Version Incident - January 28, 2025

### üî¥ INCIDENT SUMMARY

**What Happened**: The old/inferior version of the AUPEX website was live at aupex.ai instead of the new version with 3D animations and professional features.

**Impact**: 
- Professional website with Three.js animations was NOT visible to users
- Old basic website was serving instead
- This was "unacceptable" and required immediate correction

**Root Cause**: Nginx was configured to serve from `/usr/share/nginx/html` but the new website was deployed to `/var/www/html`

---

### üìä TIMELINE OF EVENTS

1. **July 26, 2025**: Initial website deployment (unclear which version)
2. **July 27, 2025**: Documentation claimed "Professional Multi-Page Website ‚úÖ DEPLOYED"
3. **January 28, 2025**: Discovery that wrong version was live
4. **Resolution**: 
   - Found nginx serving from wrong directory
   - Copied correct files to `/usr/share/nginx/html`
   - Website immediately corrected

---

### üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

#### Primary Cause: Directory Mismatch
```
Expected: /var/www/html (standard web root)
Actual: /usr/share/nginx/html (nginx default)
```

#### Contributing Factors:
1. **No Verification After Deployment** - The deployment was marked "complete" without actually checking the live site
2. **Assumption About Web Root** - Assumed nginx would use `/var/www/html` without checking configuration
3. **Documentation Disconnect** - Documentation claimed deployment success without verification
4. **No Visual Testing** - Nobody actually visited http://aupex.ai to see what was live

---

### üõ†Ô∏è WHAT WENT RIGHT

1. **Quick Diagnosis** - Once reported, the issue was identified quickly
2. **Simple Fix** - Moving files to correct directory solved it immediately  
3. **No Data Loss** - Old site was backed up before replacement
4. **Clean Resolution** - New website is now properly deployed

---

### üö´ WHAT WENT WRONG

1. **False Documentation** - Marked as "deployed" without verification
2. **Wrong Assumptions** - Assumed standard web root without checking
3. **No Testing Protocol** - No post-deployment verification steps
4. **Communication Gap** - Nobody noticed for months that wrong site was live

---

### üìã ACTION ITEMS TO PREVENT RECURRENCE

#### 1. MANDATORY POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION
```bash
# Add to ALL deployment scripts:
echo "Verifying deployment..."
EXPECTED_CONTENT="AUREN - Neural Optimization Intelligence"
ACTUAL_CONTENT=$(curl -s http://aupex.ai | grep -o "<title>.*</title>")

if [[ "$ACTUAL_CONTENT" == *"$EXPECTED_CONTENT"* ]]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Correct website deployed"
else
    echo "‚ùå WRONG WEBSITE VERSION DETECTED!"
    exit 1
fi
```

#### 2. NGINX CONFIGURATION DOCUMENTATION
Create `NGINX_CONFIG_STANDARD.md`:
```
ALWAYS CHECK NGINX ROOT DIRECTORY:
- Run: grep -r "root" /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
- Verify before deploying files
- Update deployment scripts with correct path
```

#### 3. VISUAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
Add to deployment procedures:
- [ ] Visit website in browser
- [ ] Check for 3D animations
- [ ] Verify navigation works
- [ ] Screenshot and attach to deployment report
- [ ] Get human confirmation: "Does this look correct?"

#### 4. AUTOMATED MONITORING
```python
# Add to monitoring system
def check_website_version():
    response = requests.get("http://aupex.ai")
    if "Three.js" not in response.text:
        alert("WRONG WEBSITE VERSION DETECTED!")
```

#### 5. DEPLOYMENT SCRIPT ENHANCEMENT
```bash
# deploy_website.sh should include:
1. Check nginx config first
2. Deploy to correct directory
3. Verify deployment
4. Run visual tests
5. Generate deployment report with screenshots
```

---

### üéØ SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

#### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Do Now):

1. **Update All Deployment Scripts**
   ```bash
   # Add to every deployment script
   NGINX_ROOT=$(grep -h "root" /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/* | head -1 | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d ';')
   echo "Nginx serving from: $NGINX_ROOT"
   ```

2. **Create Deployment Verification Script**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # verify_deployment.sh
   curl -s http://aupex.ai | grep -q "Three.js" && echo "‚úÖ New site" || echo "‚ùå Old site"
   ```

3. **Document Nginx Configuration**
   - Add to `AUREN_DOCS/03_OPERATIONS/NGINX_CONFIGURATION.md`
   - Include exact paths and configuration

#### LONG-TERM IMPROVEMENTS:

1. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Automated testing after deployment
   - Screenshot capture for visual verification
   - Rollback capability if wrong version detected

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Use Ansible/Terraform for nginx config
   - Version control all server configurations
   - Single source of truth for paths

3. **Monitoring & Alerts**
   - Set up uptime monitoring that checks content
   - Alert if website title changes
   - Daily automated visual regression tests

4. **Team Procedures**
   - Deployment requires 2-person verification
   - One deploys, one verifies
   - Sign-off required before marking "complete"

---

### üîí PREVENTION COMMITMENT

**We commit to**:
1. Never marking anything "deployed" without verification
2. Always checking nginx configuration before deployment  
3. Implementing automated post-deployment tests
4. Maintaining accurate documentation only

**New Rule**: "TRUST BUT VERIFY" - Even if deployment script says success, human must confirm

---

### üìù LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Documentation ‚â† Reality** - What's written may not reflect actual state
2. **Assumptions Kill** - Never assume standard configurations
3. **Visual Verification Matters** - Automated tests miss visual issues
4. **Quick Fixes Available** - Most deployment issues are simple path problems

---

### ‚úÖ INCIDENT CLOSED

- Issue identified and resolved: January 28, 2025
- Correct website now live at http://aupex.ai
- Post-mortem completed with prevention plan
- All action items documented for implementation

**Status**: RESOLVED with prevention plan in place

*This post-mortem serves as a commitment to preventing similar issues through better verification, documentation, and testing procedures.*
