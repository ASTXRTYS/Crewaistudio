**What was built**:
- **Redis Hot Tier**: Immediate access memory (< 10ms) for current context
- **PostgreSQL Warm Tier**: Structured storage with full audit trail
- **ChromaDB Cold Tier**: Semantic search across millions of memories
- **Unified Orchestrator**: Intelligent memory flow management

**Where it lives**:
```
auren/core/memory/
â”œâ”€â”€ redis_tier.py          # Hot memory implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ postgres_tier.py       # Warm memory with event sourcing

## ðŸ§  Neuroscientist Knowledge Files

### Current Status:
The 15 Level 1 knowledge files are **NOT** automatically loaded into Redis yet. They exist as markdown files but need to be ingested.

### Where they are:
```
auren/src/agents/Level 1 knowledge/
â”œâ”€â”€ neuroscientist_hrv_analytics.md
â”œâ”€â”€ neuroscientist_semantic_router.md
â”œâ”€â”€ neuroscientist_stress_assessment.md
â””â”€â”€ ... (12 more files)
```

### What needs to happen:
1. Parse each knowledge file
2. Create memory entries for key concepts
3. Store in the memory system with high importance
4. Tag as "KNOWLEDGE" type memories

### How to load them:
```python
# Example code to load knowledge files
async def load_neuroscientist_knowledge():
    neuroscientist = NeuroscientistAgent()
    await neuroscientist.initialize()
    
    knowledge_dir = "auren/src/agents/Level 1 knowledge/"
    for file in os.listdir(knowledge_dir):
        with open(os.path.join(knowledge_dir, file)) as f:
            content = f.read()
            
        # Store as high-importance knowledge
        await neuroscientist.remember(
            content=content,
            memory_type=MemoryType.KNOWLEDGE,
            importance=0.9,
            tags=["level1", "foundational", "neuroscience"]
        )
```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring vs Dashboard Clarification

### Grafana/Prometheus (Infrastructure Monitoring)
**Purpose**: Monitor the HEALTH of your system
- Server performance (CPU, RAM, disk)
- Database query times
- Redis memory usage
- Service uptime
- Error rates

**Who uses it**: System administrators, DevOps

### AUREN Dashboard (AI Monitoring)
**Purpose**: Monitor the INTELLIGENCE of your agents
- Agent reasoning chains
- Memory access patterns

Begin with one server running everything, then distribute services as load increases.

### 3. Focus on Agent Development
The infrastructure is complete. Now create agents that leverage this powerful memory system.

### 4. Monitor Early and Often
Use Grafana to catch performance issues before they impact users.

### 5. Document Agent Patterns
As you build agents, document successful memory patterns for reuse.
