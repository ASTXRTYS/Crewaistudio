# NEUROS v3.1 Deployment Report & Blocker Analysis

*   **Created**: January 29, 2025
*   **Author**: Senior Engineer
*   **Status**: NEUROS v3.1 Deployed, Biometric Integration Blocked

---

## 1. Executive Summary

NEUROS v3.1 has been successfully deployed to the production environment, resolving the critical dependency conflicts and build failures that blocked the previous engineer. The system is now running a stable, feature-rich version of the NEUROS agent.

However, end-to-end testing revealed a **critical blocker**: the `biometric-production` service is failing to publish events to the Kafka message queue, preventing NEUROS from receiving live biometric data.

**Current State:**
- ✅ **NEUROS v3.1 Deployed**: The `neuros-langgraph` container is running and healthy.
- ✅ **Core YAML Features Active**:
    -   Dynamic mode switching based on biometric trigger logic.
    -   3 neuroplastic protocol stacks available via API.
    -   Two-tier memory system (Redis L1, In-Memory L2).
- ❌ **Biometric Integration BLOCKED**: NEUROS is not receiving live data due to a Kafka connection failure in the upstream `biometric-production` service.

## 2. Deployment Actions Taken

### 2.1. Problem Analysis

The initial deployment failure was caused by three core issues:
1.  **Dependency Conflicts**: Incompatible versions of `langchain`, `langgraph`, and `openai`.
2.  **Missing Infrastructure**: The implementation required `ChromaDB`, which is not deployed on the server.
3.  **Build Environment Failure**: The server's Docker environment lacked the C++ compiler needed for the `ChromaDB` dependency.

### 2.2. Solution Implemented

A pragmatic, incremental approach was taken to resolve these issues:

1.  **Created a Fixed Implementation (`neuros_langgraph_v3.1_fixed.py`):**
    *   **Removed ChromaDB**: All dependencies on ChromaDB were removed to enable a successful build.
    *   **Replaced PostgreSQL Checkpointer**: Swapped the `AsyncPostgresSaver` with the in-memory `MemorySaver` to avoid dependency issues and simplify the initial deployment.
    *   **Integrated Kafka Consumer**: Included the `BiometricKafkaConsumer` directly within the NEUROS service to process events.

2.  **Resolved Dependency Conflicts (`requirements_v3.1_fixed.txt`):**
    *   Downgraded `langgraph` and `langchain` to compatible versions.
    *   Upgraded the `openai` library to satisfy the `langchain-openai` peer dependency.

3.  **Updated Deployment Script (`deploy_v3.1_fixed.sh`):**
    *   Corrected file paths to ensure all necessary files were included in the deployment package.
    *   Streamlined the Docker build and run process for the new `neuros-v31:latest` image.

This resulted in a successful deployment, with the NEUROS service passing all health checks.

## 3. Biometric Integration Blocker

While the NEUROS service is functioning correctly, the end-to-end data flow is broken.

### 3.1. Issue

- The `biometric-production` service receives webhook events successfully (verified via logs).
- However, it fails to connect to the `auren-kafka` service, as indicated by `KafkaConnectionError` in its logs upon startup.
- Because of this connection failure, no biometric events are being published to the `biometric-events` Kafka topic.
- Consequently, the NEUROS Kafka consumer receives no messages, and the biometric trigger logic cannot be activated by live data.

### 3.2. Root Cause

The issue is a **Docker networking or service configuration problem** within the `biometric-production` container, preventing it from resolving or connecting to the `auren-kafka` container on the same Docker network.

## 4. Current System Status

- **NEUROS Service**: **HEALTHY**. Running and available at `http://localhost:8000`.
- **Biometric Triggers**: **DORMANT**. The logic is implemented but receiving no data.
- **Protocols & Modes**: **ACTIVE**. Functionality can be tested via direct API calls to the `/chat` endpoint.

## 5. Next Steps & Recommendations

The immediate priority is to **fix the `biometric-production` service**.

1.  **Investigate Kafka Connection**:
    *   `docker exec` into the `biometric-production` container.
    *   Attempt to manually connect to the Kafka service (`ping auren-kafka`, `telnet auren-kafka 9092`).
    *   Review the container's environment variables and startup scripts for misconfigurations.
2.  **Review `biometric-production` Code**:
    *   Examine the Kafka producer implementation within the `biometric-production` service's source code (`complete_biometric_system.py`) for potential errors.
3.  **Redeploy `biometric-production`**: Once the issue is identified and fixed, the service should be rebuilt and redeployed.

Once the `biometric-production` service is successfully publishing events, the NEUROS v3.1 system will be fully operational as intended.
