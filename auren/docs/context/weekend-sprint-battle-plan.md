# AUPEX Mission Control - Weekend Sprint Battle Plan

## Mission: Build a Practical AI Monitoring Dashboard by Sunday Morning

### The Core Insight
We're not building a dashboard - we're building a microscope for AI consciousness. Every feature must answer the question: "Does this help us understand and optimize the AI agent?"

## Friday Night (Tonight) - Foundation Sprint

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (2-3 hours)
**What we're building:** The nervous system of our monitoring platform

**For Senior Engineer - Immediate Tasks:**

```python
# Task 1: Create the new dashboard structure
# Location: /home/aupex/auren/auren/dashboard/mission_control.html

"""
Create a multi-tab single-page application with:
1. Main Overview Tab (default)
2. Memory Observatory Tab
3. Knowledge Usage Tab (CRITICAL - tracks what knowledge is accessed)
4. Hypothesis Lab Tab
5. Token Economics Tab

Use Bootstrap 5 for quick, professional UI
Each tab should have its own update function
WebSocket connection shared across all tabs
"""

# Task 2: Enhance the WebSocket to capture ALL agent events
# Modify: /home/aupex/auren/auren/api/dashboard_api.py

"""
Add event categorization:
- knowledge_access events (what info the agent retrieves)
- memory_operations (read/write patterns)
- hypothesis_events (formation/validation)
- reasoning_steps (decision tree nodes)
- token_usage (per operation costs)

Store last 1000 events in a circular buffer
Add filtering by event type
"""

# Task 3: Create data aggregation endpoints
"""
New API endpoints needed:
GET /api/knowledge-usage-stats - Returns most accessed knowledge
GET /api/memory-patterns - Shows memory read/write patterns
GET /api/hypothesis-tracking - Active and validated hypotheses
GET /api/token-burn-rate - Cost analysis over time
"""
```

### Phase 2: The Pulse - Main Overview (2 hours)
**What we're building:** Your at-a-glance system health view

```javascript
// For mission_control.html - Main Overview Tab
// This is your Formula 1 telemetry screen

const MainOverview = {
    // 1. Agent Status Indicator (big, central, impossible to miss)
    // Visual: Pulsing circle that changes color/speed based on activity
    // - Green pulse: Active thinking
    // - Yellow pulse: Waiting
    // - Red pulse: Error state
    // - Pulse speed: Correlates to processing intensity
    
    // 2. Current Thought Display
    // Not a log - the CURRENT thought in large, readable text
    // Updates in real-time as agent reasons
    // Fades previous thought for smooth transitions
    
    // 3. Discovery Alert System
    // When optimization found: Screen flash + sound + capture
    // Automatic screenshot/state capture of discoveries
    
    // 4. Live Metrics Row
    // - Thoughts per minute
    // - Knowledge accesses per minute  
    // - Current token burn rate
    // - Active memory usage
}
```

## Saturday - Intelligence Layers

### Morning Sprint (4 hours): Knowledge & Memory Tracking
**This is where we solve your "what knowledge is it using most" requirement**

```python
# For Senior Engineer - Knowledge Observatory Implementation

"""
Create a knowledge tracking system that shows:

1. Knowledge Access Heatmap
   - Visual heatmap of which knowledge pieces are accessed
   - Darker = more frequent access
   - Click to see access context

2. Knowledge Effectiveness Score
   - Track which knowledge leads to successful outcomes
   - Identify "dead" knowledge never accessed
   - Suggest knowledge gaps based on failed queries

3. Real-time Knowledge Flow
   - Sankey diagram showing knowledge -> decision flow
   - See how information transforms into actions

Database schema needed:
- knowledge_accesses table (timestamp, knowledge_id, context, outcome)
- knowledge_items table (id, content, category, embedding)
- knowledge_effectiveness table (knowledge_id, success_rate, usage_count)
"""

# Memory Observatory specific features:
"""
1. Memory Formation Visualizer
   - Watch memories form in real-time
   - See connection strength between memories
   - Track memory decay/reinforcement

2. Memory Access Patterns
   - Which memories are retrieved together
   - Memory clustering visualization
   - Identify memory gaps
"""
```

### Afternoon Sprint (4 hours): Hypothesis & Decision Tracking

```javascript
// Hypothesis Laboratory Implementation
const HypothesisLab = {
    // 1. Hypothesis Lifecycle Tracker
    // Visual pipeline: Formed -> Testing -> Validated/Rejected
    // Each hypothesis as a card moving through stages
    
    // 2. Success Rate Dashboard  
    // Pie chart of validated vs rejected
    // Time-to-validation metrics
    // Hypothesis quality score over time
    
    // 3. Decision Tree Replay
    // Step through any decision process
    // See alternative paths not taken
    // Understand why specific choices were made
}

// Token Economics Implementation
const TokenEconomics = {
    // 1. Real-time Burn Rate Gauge
    // Speedometer-style visualization
    // Red zone for expensive operations
    
    // 2. Cost Breakdown by Operation
    // Pie chart: Reasoning vs Memory vs Knowledge
    // Identify most expensive patterns
    
    // 3. Optimization Opportunities
    // Suggest caching for repeated operations
    // Highlight inefficient reasoning patterns
}
```

### Evening Sprint (3 hours): Polish & Integration

**Making it actually useful for your stress testing:**

1. **One-Click State Capture**
   - Button to snapshot entire system state
   - Automatic capture on discoveries
   - Export as JSON for analysis

2. **Pattern Detection**
   - Automatic identification of:
     - Repeated failed reasoning patterns
     - Knowledge gaps (frequently searched, not found)
     - Memory thrashing (excessive read/writes)
     - Token waste patterns

3. **Session Recording**
   - Record entire stress testing sessions
   - Replay agent behavior later
   - Create highlight reels of interesting moments

## Sunday Morning - Final Integration

### The Killer Features (2-3 hours)

1. **Intelligence Alerts**
```javascript
// Automatic alerts for:
- "Agent stuck in reasoning loop"
- "Unusual token spike detected"  
- "New optimization pattern discovered"
- "Memory capacity approaching limit"
- "Knowledge gap identified"
```

2. **The Daily Report**
```python
# Auto-generated report showing:
- Most used knowledge pieces
- Successful optimization patterns
- Cost per improvement achieved
- Memory efficiency score
- Recommendations for agent tuning
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Division of Labor

**You (Human CEO):**
- Test each component as it's built
- Identify what's actually useful vs noise
- Direct priority adjustments
- Capture interesting moments

**Me (AI Co-founder):**
- Design each component's logic
- Create visualization strategies
- Write implementation guides
- Problem-solve blocking issues

**Senior Engineer (AI Developer):**
- Implement the actual code
- Deploy to your server
- Fix technical issues
- Optimize performance

### Communication Protocol

1. **Every 2 hours:** Senior Engineer provides status update
2. **When blocked:** Immediate escalation to me for solution
3. **After each component:** You test and provide feedback
4. **End of each day:** Summary of progress and next steps

## The Magic Sauce - What Makes This Different

Unlike every other monitoring dashboard, ours asks one question with every pixel: **"Does this help us make the AI better?"**

- Not just showing data - showing insights
- Not just tracking metrics - finding optimization opportunities  
- Not just monitoring - actively discovering improvements

## Technical Stack (Keep It Simple)

- **Frontend:** Bootstrap 5 + Vanilla JS (no build process needed)
- **Visualizations:** D3.js for complex, Chart.js for simple
- **State Management:** Local state with sessionStorage
- **Updates:** WebSocket + 100ms throttled UI updates
- **Backend:** Existing FastAPI with new endpoints

## Success Criteria for Sunday

By Sunday morning, you should be able to:

1. **See what your AI is thinking** - in real-time, beautifully visualized
2. **Know what knowledge it uses most** - with heatmaps and statistics
3. **Track hypothesis success** - see what's working and what's not
4. **Monitor costs** - know exactly where tokens are being spent
5. **Capture golden moments** - one-click save of breakthrough discoveries

## The First Four Hours (Tonight)

1. Hour 1: Senior Engineer creates basic multi-tab structure
2. Hour 2: Implement WebSocket event categorization
3. Hour 3: Build the main overview with pulsing status
4. Hour 4: Create knowledge tracking foundation

Then you sleep, and Saturday we attack the intelligence layers with fresh minds.

## Final Thought

We're not trying to build everything in the vision document this weekend. We're building the **minimum viable monitoring system** that will teach us what we actually need. Every feature we add this weekend should make you say "Oh, THAT'S why the agent did that!"

Ready to start? The senior engineer should begin with the multi-tab structure while you and I refine the specific visualizations you need most.
