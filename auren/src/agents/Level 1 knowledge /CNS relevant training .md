## 📊 Critical Training Load Thresholds

### Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR)
**Risk-Benefit Sweet Spot**:
- **Optimal range**: 0.8 - 1.3 
- **Low injury risk**: 0.9 - 1.2
- **Undertraining risk**: <0.8 (deconditioning)
- **Injury risk elevation**: >1.3 (moderate risk)
- **High injury risk**: >1.5 (21-49% increased risk)
- **Very high risk**: >2.0 (significant injury probability)

**Calculation Method**:
```
ACWR = Acute Load (7 days) / Chronic Load (28 days average)
Weekly Load = Session RPE × Duration (minutes)
```

**Application Guidelines**:
- Monitor weekly for all athletes
- Adjust training when approaching 1.3
- Plan deloads when consistently >1.2
- Gradual build-ups after time off

### Progressive Overload Boundaries
**Weekly Load Increases**:
- **Conservative**: 5-10% per week
- **Moderate**: 10-15% per week  
- **Aggressive**: >15% per week (elevated injury risk)
- **Deload weeks**: 40-60% of peak weekly load

**Volume Progression**:
- **Beginner**: 10-20% volume increases
- **Intermediate**: 5-15% volume increases
- **Advanced**: 2.5-10% volume increases
- **Volume ceiling**: Individual tolerance varies significantly

### Session RPE & Internal Load
**RPE Scale Interpretation** (1-10):
- **1-3**: Very easy, recovery/warm-up
- **4-5**: Easy, aerobic base building
- **6-7**: Moderate, tempo/threshold work
- **8-9**: Hard, high-intensity training
- **10**: Maximal effort, competition/testing

**Session Load Calculation**:
```
Session Load = RPE × Duration (minutes)
Daily Total = Sum of all session loads
Weekly Total = Sum of 7 consecutive days
```

**Red Flag Indicators**:
- Daily loads consistently >800-1000
- Weekly loads >6000-8000 (sport dependent)
- RPE >8 for >50% of sessions

- **Minor muscles**: 6-10 sets/week

**Maximum Adaptive Volume (MAV)**:
- **Major muscles**: 16-22 sets/week
- **Minor muscles**: 12-16 sets/week

**Maximum Recoverable Volume (MRV)**:
- **Highly individual**: 20-30+ sets/week possible

### Rep Range Optimization
**Hypertrophy Rep Ranges**:
- **Primary**: 6-12 reps (most research support)
- **Secondary**: 12-20 reps (metabolic stress)
- **Tertiary**: 1-5 reps (mechanical tension)

**Intensity Distribution**:
- **65-85% 1RM**: Primary hypertrophy zone
- **50-65% 1RM**: High rep, metabolic stress
- **85-95% 1RM**: Strength contribution to hypertrophy

### Progressive Overload Strategies
**Week-to-Week Progression**:
1. **Add reps**: Increase by 1-2 reps until upper range reached
2. **Add weight**: Increase load 2.5-5%, drop reps to lower range
3. **Add sets**: Increase volume by 1 set per week
4. **Improve technique**: Better form = more effective stimulus

**Deload Strategies**:
- **Volume deload**: Reduce sets by 40-50%
- **Intensity deload**: Reduce load by 20-30%
- **Complete rest**: 5-7 days off training

## 📚 Quick Reference Calculations

### Training Load Calculations
```
Session RPE Load = RPE (1-10) × Duration (minutes)
Weekly Load = Sum of 7 consecutive daily loads
ACWR = Current week load / Average of previous 4 weeks
```

### Volume Progression
```
Weekly Volume Increase = (Current Week - Previous Week) / Previous Week × 100
Safe progression: <15% per week
Deload week: 40-60% of peak week
```

### Intensity Zones
```
Strength: 85-95% 1RM, 1-5 reps
Hypertrophy: 65-85% 1RM, 6-12 reps  
Power: 30-70% 1RM, 1-5 reps (maximal velocity)
Endurance: <65% 1RM, >12 reps
```

### Recovery Ratios
```
Strength training: Work:Rest = 1:3-5
Power training: Work:Rest = 1:5-8
Hypertrophy: Work:Rest = 1:2-3
Circuit training: Work:Rest = 1:1-2
```
