## ðŸ“Š Critical Thresholds & Decision Points

### Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Guidelines
**Baseline Establishment**: 7-14 days of morning measurements
- **Normal Range**: 20-89ms RMSSD (varies by individual)
- **Warning Zone**: >1 SD below personal baseline
- **Action Required**: >2 SD below baseline (mandatory recovery)
- **Overtraining Indicator**: >2.5 SD below for 3+ consecutive days

**Clinical Interpretation**:
```
>50ms RMSSD: Excellent recovery, high training readiness
30-50ms RMSSD: Good recovery, normal training OK
20-30ms RMSSD: Moderate fatigue, reduce intensity 20%
<20ms RMSSD: High fatigue, active recovery only
<15ms RMSSD: Severe fatigue, complete rest day
```

### CNS Recovery Protocols
**Post-Training Recovery Windows**:
- **Upper body intense**: 24-48 hours
- **Lower body intense**: 72-96 hours
- **Full body compound**: 48-72 hours
- **CNS-demanding sports**: 48-96 hours

**Recovery Markers**:
- HRV returns to within 1 SD of baseline
- Resting HR <5 bpm above baseline
- Subjective energy >7/10
- Reaction time <500ms average

### Sleep Architecture Optimization
**Sleep Stages Distribution (Healthy Adults)**:
- **N1 (Light)**: 5-10% of total sleep
- **N2 (Light)**: 45-55% of total sleep  
- **N3 (Deep)**: 15-20% of total sleep
- **REM**: 20-25% of total sleep

**Sleep Quality Thresholds**:
- **Sleep Efficiency**: >85% (time asleep / time in bed)
- **Sleep Onset**: <20 minutes to fall asleep
- **Wake Episodes**: <2 per night, <15 minutes each
- **REM Duration**: 90-120 minutes total per night
- **Deep Sleep**: 62-110 minutes for recovery

**Sleep Optimization Protocol**:
1. **Consistency**: Same bedtime Â±30 minutes nightly
2. **Environment**: 65-68Â°F, darkness, quiet
3. **Pre-sleep**: No screens 1hr before, no caffeine 8hr before
4. **Recovery Sleep**: Deep sleep % increases post-exercise

## ðŸ”¬ Assessment Tools & Protocols

### Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT)
**Purpose**: Measure cognitive fatigue and attention
**Protocol**: 10-minute sustained attention reaction time test
**Interpretation**:
- **Alert**: <300ms average reaction time
- **Mild fatigue**: 300-400ms average
- **Moderate fatigue**: 400-500ms average
- **Severe fatigue**: >500ms average (cognitive impairment)

**Implementation**:
- Morning baseline after good sleep
- Post-training assessment
- Daily monitoring during intense phases

### CNS Load Scoring System
**Components** (Rate 1-10, sum for total):
1. **Training Intensity**: RPE Ã— session duration (minutes)
2. **Sleep Quality**: (10 - sleep quality rating)  
3. **Life Stress**: Work/personal stress level
4. **Caffeine Dependency**: Cups consumed Ã— 2
5. **Alcohol Impact**: Drinks previous 24h Ã— 3

**Interpretation**:
- **Low Load**: <20 (normal training)
- **Moderate Load**: 20-35 (monitor closely)
- **High Load**: 35-50 (reduce intensity)
- **Excessive Load**: >50 (mandatory rest)

### Fatigue Pattern Recognition
**Early Warning Signs**:
- HRV declining trend >3 days
- Resting HR elevated >5 bpm
- Sleep efficiency dropping <80%
- Mood scores declining
- Motivation for training decreasing

**Intervention Triggers**:
- Any 2 warning signs present = reduce training 25%
- Any 3 warning signs present = active recovery only
- All 5 warning signs present = complete rest 48-72hrs

## ðŸŽ¯ Intervention Protocols

### HRV-Guided Training Recommendations
**Green Zone** (HRV >baseline): 
- High intensity training OK
- Skill work and power development
- Normal training loads

**Yellow Zone** (HRV 1 SD below):
- Reduce intensity 20-30%
- Focus on technique and mobility
- Increase sleep emphasis

**Red Zone** (HRV >2 SD below):
- Active recovery only
- Stress management techniques
- Sleep optimization priority

### Sleep Intervention Hierarchy
**Level 1** (Sleep efficiency 80-85%):
- Optimize sleep environment
- Review caffeine timing
- Establish wind-down routine

**Level 2** (Sleep efficiency 70-80%):
- Sleep restriction therapy
- Light exposure management
- Magnesium supplementation

**Level 3** (Sleep efficiency <70%):
- Professional sleep study
- Potential sleep disorder screening
- Comprehensive lifestyle audit

### Cognitive Enhancement Protocols
**Acute Performance** (competition day):
- 15-20 minute power nap if possible
- Caffeine 3-6mg/kg body weight
- Cold exposure 2-3 minutes

**Chronic Adaptation** (training phases):
- Meditation 10-20 minutes daily
- Regular exercise (improves cognitive function)
- Omega-3 supplementation

## ðŸ”„ Recovery Modalities & Evidence

### Active Recovery Guidelines
**Light Movement** (RPE 2-4):
- Walking 20-30 minutes
- Easy swimming/cycling
- Yoga or tai chi
- Improves circulation without CNS stress

### Passive Recovery Tools
**Cold Therapy**:
- **Ice baths**: 10-15Â°C, 10-15 minutes
- **Cold showers**: 2-3 minutes cold finish
- **Cryotherapy**: 2-3 minutes, -110Â°C
- Evidence: Reduces inflammation, improves recovery

**Heat Therapy**:
- **Sauna**: 80-90Â°C, 15-20 minutes
- **Hot baths**: 40-42Â°C, 12-15 minutes
- Evidence: Improves circulation, heat shock proteins

**Contrast Therapy**:
- Alternating hot/cold
- 3-4 cycles, 3-4 minutes each
- End with cold for alertness, hot for relaxation

### Supplementation for CNS Recovery
**Tier 1 (Strong Evidence)**:
- **Magnesium**: 400-600mg before bed (sleep quality)
- **Omega-3**: 2-3g daily (inflammation, cognitive function)

## ðŸ“š Quick Reference Formulas

### CNS Fatigue Score
```
CNS Score = (Baseline HRV - Current HRV) / Baseline SD
Score 0-1: Normal fatigue
Score 1-2: Moderate fatigue  
Score 2+: High fatigue
```

### Sleep Debt Calculation
```
Sleep Debt = (Optimal Hours Ã— Days) - Actual Sleep Hours
<5 hours debt: Normal
5-10 hours debt: Moderate debt
>10 hours debt: Significant debt requiring intervention
```

### Recovery Time Estimation
```
Base Recovery (hours) = Training Load Ã— Individual Factor
Individual Factor: 0.8 (fast), 1.0 (average), 1.3 (slow)
Add 25% for each stressor present
```
