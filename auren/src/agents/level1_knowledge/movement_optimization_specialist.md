## 📊 Critical Assessment Thresholds

### Functional Movement Screen (FMS) Guidelines
**Scoring System** (0-3 points per test, 7 tests total):
- **3**: Able to perform movement without compensation
- **2**: Able to perform but with some compensation  
- **1**: Unable to perform movement correctly
- **0**: Pain during movement (immediate referral needed)

**Risk Stratification**:
- **≤14 total score**: 5.8x higher injury risk
- **15-17 total score**: Moderate injury risk
- **≥18 total score**: Low injury risk
- **Any 0 score**: High priority correction needed

**Seven Movement Patterns**:
1. **Deep Squat**: Hip/ankle mobility, core stability
2. **Hurdle Step**: Single-leg stability, hip mobility
3. **In-Line Lunge**: Multi-planar stability, hip mobility
4. **Shoulder Mobility**: Bilateral shoulder ROM
5. **Active Straight Leg Raise**: Hip mobility, core stability
6. **Trunk Stability Push-Up**: Core stability, proprioception
7. **Rotary Stability**: Multi-planar core stability

### Y-Balance Test Thresholds
**Normative Values** (% of leg length):
- **Anterior reach**: 85-115% leg length
- **Posteromedial reach**: 95-125% leg length
- **Posterolateral reach**: 90-120% leg length

**Injury Risk Indicators**:
- **>4cm asymmetry**: Increased injury risk
- **Composite score <89%**: Higher injury probability
- **Anterior reach <65%**: Significant mobility deficit

**Age-Related Adjustments**:
- **10-14 years**: Lower normative values expected
- **15-18 years**: Adult normatives apply
- **40+ years**: Allow 5-10% reduction in norms

### Joint Mobility Assessment
**Ankle Dorsiflexion**:
- **Normal**: 15-20° from neutral
- **Functional minimum**: 10-15° for squatting
- **Assessment**: Wall ankle test, >4 inches from wall

**Hip Flexion**:
- **Normal**: 120-135° passive
- **Functional**: 90° active for daily activities
- **Assessment**: Thomas test, 90/90 test

**Thoracic Spine Extension**:

## 📚 Quick Reference Assessment Tools

### Movement Screen Checklist
```
FMS Quick Screen:
□ Deep squat: Heels down, knees tracking, trunk upright
□ Hurdle step: Level hips, no knee valgus, maintain balance
□ In-line lunge: No trunk lean, maintain heel contact
□ Shoulder mobility: Hands within fist-width
□ ASLR: Maintain neutral spine, achieve 70°
□ Trunk stability: Males from toes, females from knees
□ Rotary stability: Maintain plank, controlled movement
```

### Common Compensation Patterns
```
Squat Compensations:
- Knees cave in → Hip strengthening needed
- Heels rise → Ankle mobility limitation
- Forward lean → Hip mobility or core weakness
- Asymmetry → Unilateral dysfunction

Overhead Compensations:
- Lumbar arch → Lat/pec tightness
- Shoulder shrug → Upper trap dominance
- Head forward → Thoracic kyphosis
- Unequal reach → Unilateral restriction
```

### Daily Movement Maintenance
```
Morning Activation (5 minutes):
- Glute bridges: 10 reps
- Cat-cow: 10 reps
- Arm circles: 10 each direction
- Leg swings: 10 each direction

Evening Restoration (10 minutes):
