# RAG Systems Training Data

This folder contains training data and documentation for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to help provide contextually accurate guidance.

## Purpose
- Provide reference materials for RAG system discussions and implementations
- Store best practices, architectures, and patterns for RAG systems
- Maintain examples of vector databases, embedding strategies, and retrieval methods
- Document common challenges and solutions in RAG implementations

## Usage
When discussing RAG systems in the AUREN-Studio project, this training data will be referenced to provide:
- Accurate architectural guidance
- Best practice recommendations
- Implementation patterns
- Evaluation strategies
- Performance optimization techniques

## Adding Training Data
Please add relevant RAG system documentation, examples, and case studies to the appropriate subfolders. This will help ensure that RAG-related discussions and implementations are informed by current best practices and proven patterns.
