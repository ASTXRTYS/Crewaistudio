# RAG System Architectures

This folder contains architectural patterns and designs for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems.

## Common RAG Architectures

### 1. Basic RAG Pipeline
- Document ingestion and preprocessing
- Embedding generation
- Vector storage
- Query processing
- Retrieval and ranking
- Context assembly
- LLM generation

### 2. Advanced RAG Patterns
- Multi-stage retrieval
- Hybrid search (dense + sparse)
- Reranking strategies
- Context window optimization
- Streaming RAG
- Multi-modal RAG

### 3. Production RAG Architectures
- Scalable vector databases
- Caching strategies
- Load balancing
- Monitoring and observability
- A/B testing frameworks

## Key Considerations
- Latency vs. accuracy trade-offs
- Cost optimization
- Scalability requirements
- Data freshness requirements
- Security and privacy
- Compliance considerations

## Implementation Patterns
- Microservices architecture
- Event-driven processing
- Batch vs. real-time processing
- Multi-tenant designs
- Edge deployment strategies
