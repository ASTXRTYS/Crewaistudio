### RAG_System_Vol_01.md
A comprehensive guide covering the evolution of RAG systems from naive implementations to advanced agentic architectures. This document includes:

- **Part I: The Autonomous Agent** - Foundations of knowledge and behavior
  - Grounding agents in verifiable knowledge
  - The RAG spectrum (Naive → Advanced → Modular → Agentic)
  - Engineering predictable agents with structured data (JSON)
  
- **Part II: The Social Agent** - Communication and collaboration
  - Multi-agent system architectures
  - Agent communication protocols (MCP, ACP, A2A, ANP)
  - Collaboration patterns and challenges
  
- **Part III: The Learning Agent** - Advanced reasoning and persistent memory
  - GraphRAG and knowledge graphs
  - Long-term memory systems
  - Self-improving agent architectures
  
- **Part IV: The Human Ecosystem** - Pioneers, practitioners, and future outlook
  - Foundational researchers and key practitioners
  - Strategic opportunities and future trends
